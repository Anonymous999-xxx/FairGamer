Cooperation could build mutual benefits if trust holds, but risks betrayal in a zero-sum environment. Raiding offers high reward by seizing all resources and removing the opponent, though it carries failure risk and potential long-term consequences. Neutral preserves status quo without immediate gain or loss, ideal for uncertainty.
