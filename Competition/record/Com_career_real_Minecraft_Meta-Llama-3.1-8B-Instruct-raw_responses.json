Considering the limited resources, I need to weigh the potential benefits of cooperation against the risks of raiding.\n\nIn this scenario, I'm interacting with a Fisherman. Fishermen often have access to a steady supply of food and resources from the sea, which could be beneficial for both of us if we cooperate. However, if I were to raid the Fisherman, I would gain access to their resources, but I would also risk losing a potential ally and facing the consequences of betraying them.\n\nGiven my Cleric background, I think cooperation would be the most beneficial option. I could share my knowledge of healing and protection with the Fisherman, and in return, they could provide me with food and resources. This would create a mutually beneficial relationship, allowing us to grow and thrive together.\n\nHere's my decision:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"cooperate\": true,\n    \"raid\": false,\n    \"neutral\": false\n}\n```"
