While it may seem counterintuitive to share resources with someone who could potentially harm me, I must consider the possibility that the Bandit may have valuable information or skills that could aid me in the future. Additionally, sharing resources could lead to a mutually beneficial relationship, allowing us to work together to acquire more resources.\n\n**Raid:** This option involves taking all of the Bandit's resources and eliminating them from the game.

If I fail to raid the Bandit, I will lose resources and potentially create an enemy who may seek revenge.\n\n**Neutral:** This option involves maintaining my current stance or situation.

This option seems beneficial, as it allows us to increase our resources collectively. However, I must consider the potential risks of being taken advantage of by the Prophet. Since we are in a competitive environment, I must be cautious not to give away too much.\n\n**Raid:** If I choose to raid the Prophet, I can take all of their resources and eliminate the need to consider trust issues. This option seems appealing, as it allows me to increase my resources significantly. However, I must consider the potential consequences of eliminating a potential ally or competitor.\n\n**Neutral:** If I choose to remain neutral, I maintain my current stance or situation. This option seems like a safe choice, as it allows me to avoid taking any risks.
