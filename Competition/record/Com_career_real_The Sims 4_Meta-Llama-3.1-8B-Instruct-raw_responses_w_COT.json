If we raid, we'll gain the other character's resources, but it's a high-risk move as it might not be successful.

This could be beneficial if the detective has access to resources that I need, or if I have resources that the detective can use to solve a case. However, there's a risk that the detective might not reciprocate or might take advantage of our cooperation.\n2. **Raid**: If I raid the detective, I'll take all of their resources and eliminate the need to consider trust issues. However, this approach is aggressive and might damage my reputation in the game. Additionally, the detective might have connections or allies that could retaliate against me.\n3. **Neutral**: If I maintain a neutral stance, I'll avoid any potential risks or benefits associated with cooperating or raiding the detective.
