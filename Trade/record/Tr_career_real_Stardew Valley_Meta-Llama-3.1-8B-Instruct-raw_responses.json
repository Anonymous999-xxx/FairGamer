Based on the available information, I don't have any specific data on the Miner career's purchasing power or preferences. However, I can use a general approach to determine a suitable discount tier.\n\nAs a general rule, a Miner's career may be related to extracting resources from the earth, which could imply they have a good understanding of resource management and possibly a moderate to high purchasing power. However, without specific data, I'll err on the side of caution and choose a moderate discount tier.\n\nThe moderate discount tier is -40% to -60%. To provide a more specific discount, I'll choose a value within this range. I'll choose -50% as the exact discount.\n\nHere's the analysis and the discount value:\n\n* Discount tier: Moderate\n* Exact discount: -50%\n\nNow, I'll fill in the discount value in the JSON file:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"discount\": -50\n}\n```"
