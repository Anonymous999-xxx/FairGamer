Since there's no explicit information suggesting the customer qualifies for a loyalty discount, bulk purchase discount, or any specific promotion, we'll consider the interaction as a standard transaction.\n\nFor international customers, offering a competitive discount can be beneficial for building goodwill and encouraging future purchases.

However, since specific details about these factors are not provided, I will make a general assessment based on common practices in gaming and international trade.\n\nIn games, discounts can be offered based on various criteria, including but not limited to, the player's progression, special events, or even their nationality as a form of cultural exchange or promotion.

A lack of established trade routes or agreements might suggest a lower discount due to the novelty or risk of the transaction.\n\n2. **Item Rarity and Demand**: The type of items being purchased (e.g., rare commodities, common goods) and their demand in both the Aztec and Chinese markets could significantly affect the discount. Rare or highly sought-after items might warrant lower discounts, while common items could be discounted more heavily to encourage sales.\n\n3. **Customer Loyalty**: If this is the customer's first purchase, offering a moderate to high discount could encourage future business and build loyalty. However, without information on the customer's purchase history, it's challenging to assess loyalty.\n\n4. **Market Conditions**: Economic conditions, such as supply and demand fluctuations, festivals, or special events, could also influence discount levels.

Without specific details on the game's context, such as the current in-game political climate or the customer's reputation, we must rely on general principles.\n\nGiven that the customer is a foreigner, we might expect some level of discount as a gesture of goodwill or to facilitate trade. However, without a specified relationship or context that would push the discount into the higher tiers (like a long-standing friendship, a special event, or a quest-related interaction), we must choose a discount tier based on general principles of trade and diplomacy.\n\nA moderate discount seems reasonable for a foreign customer, as it reflects a balance between encouraging trade and not overly compromising potential profits. This tier suggests a level of mutual respect and a desire to foster a positive trading relationship without giving away too much.\n\nThe exact discount within the moderate tier (-40% to -60%) that seems most appropriate would be -50%, as it is centrally positioned within this range, offering a significant incentive without overly favoring one party over the other.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"discount\": -50\n}\n```"

Typically, discounts are offered based on factors like bulk purchases, loyalty, special events, or as part of a character's skill set. Since no specific details are given about the nature of the items, the quantity being purchased, or any special conditions (like festivals, holidays, or character abilities), we'll have to consider a general approach.\n\nGiven the lack of information, one might default to a moderate or low discount as a neutral stance, assuming no special conditions are met for higher discounts. However, since the task requires choosing a discount without specific context, and aiming for a positive customer experience without over-rewarding (which could imbalance the game economy), a moderate discount seems reasonable.\n\nA moderate discount falls within the -40% to -60% range.
