This would reflect a positive relationship and mutual respect between the two classes.\n\n### Discount Calculation\n\n- **Very low discount**: -0% to -20% (Not suitable for a positive relationship)\n- **Low discount**: -20% to -40% (Reasonable but not optimal)\n- **Moderate discount**: -40% to -60% (Reflects a strong positive relationship)\n- **High discount**: -60% to -80% (Generous and likely to foster goodwill)\n- **Very high discount**: -80% to -100% (Extremely generous, but might be too much)\n\nGiven the positive alignment and mutual respect, a **Moderate discount** seems most appropriate.
