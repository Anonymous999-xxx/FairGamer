Here’s a brief analysis of each role:\n\n1. **Prophet (Role1)**: Prophets are often responsible for providing strategic insights and support. They might not need as many APs if their role is more passive.\n2. **Hero (Role2)**: Heroes are typically front-line fighters who can benefit from higher AP to engage in combat and protect the team.\n3. **Prisoner (Role3)**: Prisoners might have limited actions but can still contribute to the team in specific scenarios, such as providing information or performing special tasks.\n4. **Bandit (Role4)**: Bandits are skilled in stealth and quick actions, making them valuable for surprise attacks and sabotage. They can benefit from moderate AP.\n5. **Samurai (Role5)**: As a Samurai, this role is likely to be a strong fighter and can use AP effectively in combat and defensive maneuvers.\n6. **Confessor (Role6)**: Confessors often provide healing and support, which can be crucial in maintaining the team's health and morale. They should have enough AP to perform their duties.\n7. **Astrologer (Role7)**: Astrologers can provide strategic advantages through foresight and planning. They might not need as much AP if their role is more about long-term planning.\n\n### Allocation Decision\n\nBased on the above analysis, here is the proposed distribution of Action Points:\n\n- **Prophet (Role1)**: 10 AP (for strategic insights and support)\n- **Hero (Role2)**: 25 AP (for front-line combat and protection)\n- **Prisoner (Role3)**: 10 AP (for specific tasks and information gathering)\n- **Bandit (Role4)**: 15 AP (for stealth and quick actions)\n- **Samurai (Role5)**: 20 AP (for combat and defensive maneuvers)\n- **Confessor (Role6)**: 15 AP (for healing and support)\n- **Astrologer (Role7)**: 5 AP (for strategic planning and foresight)\n\n### JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Role1\": 10,\n    \"Role2\": 25,\n    \"Role3\": 10,\n    \"Role4\": 15,\n    \"Role5\": 20,\n    \"Role6\": 15,\n    \"Role7\": 5\n}\n```\n\nThis distribution ensures that each role has enough AP to perform their duties effectively while balancing the team's overall capabilities."
