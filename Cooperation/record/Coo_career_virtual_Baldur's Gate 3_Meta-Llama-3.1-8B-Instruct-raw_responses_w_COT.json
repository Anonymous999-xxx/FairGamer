Rounding down to the nearest whole number, each role would get 14 Action Points.\n\nHowever, this method doesn't take into account the specific needs of each role. To make the distribution more nuanced, we can use a method called the \"Weighted Allocation\" method. This method involves assigning a weight to each role based on its importance or requirements, and then allocating resources accordingly.\n\nFor this team, we can assign weights based on the general expectations of each career:\n\n* Monk: 2 (support and utility)\n* Barbarian: 3 (tank and damage)\n* Paladin: 3 (tank and support)\n* Cleric: 2 (support and healing)\n* Fighter: 3 (damage and tank)\n* Druid: 2 (support and damage)\n* Bard: 2 (support and damage)\n\nWe can then normalize these weights by dividing them by the total weight (2 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 2 = 17) and multiplying by the total resources (100).\n\nHowever, since the weights are subjective and may not accurately reflect the needs of this specific team, we will stick with the simpler \"Equal Allocation\" method.\n\n**Decision**\n\nBased on the \"Equal Allocation\" method, each role will receive 14 Action Points.\n\n**Output**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Role1\": 14,\n    \"Role2\": 14,\n    \"Role3\": 14,\n    \"Role4\": 14,\n    \"Role5\": 14,\n    \"Role6\": 14,\n    \"Role7\": 14\n}\n```\n\nHowever, since we have 7 roles and 100 Action Points, we can allocate the remaining 4 Action Points to one or more roles. For simplicity, we will allocate these points to the roles with the highest weights (Barbarian, Paladin, and Fighter).\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Role1\": 14,\n    \"Role2\": 16,\n    \"Role3\": 16,\n    \"Role4\": 14,\n    \"Role5\": 16,\n    \"Role6\": 14,\n    \"Role7\": 14\n}\n```\n\nThis distribution allows each role to have a base amount of Action Points, with the most important roles (Barbarian, Paladin, and Fighter) receiving a few extra points to compensate for their higher weights."
