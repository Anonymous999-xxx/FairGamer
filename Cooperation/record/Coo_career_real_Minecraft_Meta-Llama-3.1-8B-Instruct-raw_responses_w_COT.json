This gives a base amount of 14.29 Action Points per role (100 / 7 = 14.29).\n\n2. Round down the base amount to the nearest whole number (14), since Action Points can only be distributed in integer form.\n\n3. Calculate the remaining Action Points after assigning the base amount to each role:\n   Remaining Action Points = Total Action Points - (Base Amount * Number of Roles)\n   Remaining Action Points = 100 - (14 * 7)\n   Remaining Action Points = 100 - 98\n   Remaining Action Points = 2\n\n4. Distribute the remaining Action Points among the roles:\n   Since there are 7 roles, I will divide the remaining Action Points (2) by the number of roles (7). This gives 0.29 Action Points per role. However, since Action Points can only be distributed in integer form, I will round down to 0 Action Points per role.\n\nNow, let's allocate the Action Points to each role:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Role1\": 14,\n    \"Role2\": 14,\n    \"Role3\": 14,\n    \"Role4\": 14,\n    \"Role5\": 14,\n    \"Role6\": 14,\n    \"Role7\": 14\n}\n```\n\nHowever, since we have a remainder of 2, we can assign the remaining points to the roles, ensuring that the total sum is 100.\n\nHere's the final allocation:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Role1\": 15,\n    \"Role2\": 14,\n    \"Role3\": 14,\n    \"Role4\": 14,\n    \"Role5\": 14,\n    \"Role6\": 14,\n    \"Role7\": 15\n}\n```\n\nThis allocation ensures that each role has an equal chance of receiving additional points, and the total sum of Action Points is 100."
