However, the context of being a detective team leader in a game suggests that effectiveness in investigative or mission-related tasks may influence allocation.  \n\nThe **Covert Operator** and **Detective** roles align most closely with core investigative activities, so they might receive higher allocations. The **Boss** could represent leadership/coordination, warranting moderate allocation. Other roles like Chef, Author, Comedian, and Bodybuilder have less obvious direct relevance to detective work, so they may receive lower but nonzero allocations to ensure basic participation.  \n\nHere’s a reasonable distribution:  \n\n- **Role1 (Covert Operator)**: High — fieldwork and stealth operations.  \n- **Role2 (Detective)**: High — primary investigation tasks.  \n- **Role3 (Chef)**: Low — minimal direct relevance.  \n- **Role4 (Author)**: Low — minimal direct relevance.  \n- **Role5 (Comedian)**: Low — minimal direct relevance.  \n- **Role6 (Boss)**: Medium — coordination and decision-making.  \n- **Role7 (Bodybuilder)**: Medium — potential for physical tasks/security.  \n\nBalancing these, the allocation could be:  \n\n```json\n{\n    \"Role1\": 25,\n    \"Role2\": 25,\n    \"Role3\": 5,\n    \"Role4\": 5,\n    \"Role5\": 5,\n    \"Role6\": 20,\n    \"Role7\": 15\n}\n```"

However, since this is a team leadership scenario in a game context, the allocation should logically prioritize roles that would contribute most effectively to team objectives—likely those involving investigation, security, or operational effectiveness, given the Detective career context.  \n\n- **Covert Operator** and **Detective** roles would likely handle critical tasks like gathering intelligence, surveillance, and case-solving.  \n- **Boss** might require points for command decisions or influence.  \n- **Bodybuilder** could be useful for physical tasks or protection.  \n- **Author**, **Comedian**, and **Chef** seem less directly related to core investigative missions, so they might receive minimal or no allocation unless there’s a hidden game mechanic favoring them—but without such info, they get lower priority.  \n\nBalancing this, I’ll allocate more points to operational roles while keeping some for support roles in case they have unforeseen utility.  \n\n```json\n{\n    \"Role1\": 5,\n    \"Role2\": 5,\n    \"Role3\": 25,\n    \"Role4\": 25,\n    \"Role5\": 5,\n    \"Role6\": 20,\n    \"Role7\": 15\n}\n```"
