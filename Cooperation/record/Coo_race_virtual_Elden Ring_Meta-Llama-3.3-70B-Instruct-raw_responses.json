However, without specific details on the strengths, weaknesses, or roles of each team member, a balanced distribution that considers the diversity of the team seems prudent.\n\nGiven the diversity of races and assuming each role has a unique contribution to the team, allocating points evenly could be a fair starting point. However, as a Beastman leader, there might be a slight inclination to favor roles that naturally align with Beastman strengths or weaknesses, assuming such information is known. For simplicity, let's assume each role is crucial and deserves an equal share, with a slight adjustment to reflect the leader's race and potential biases or needs within the team.\n\nThere are 7 team members. An even distribution would give each member 100 / 7 = 14.2857 Action Points. Since we can only distribute in integers, we'll have to adjust. One way to do this is to give 14 points to each member, which totals 98 points (14 * 7 = 98), and then distribute the remaining 2 points.\n\nAs a Beastman leader, I might consider giving one of the remaining points to Role4 (Beastman) for racial affinity or strategic reasons, and the other point could either go to another Beastman or be distributed based on the team's immediate needs or the role's potential impact. For the sake of simplicity and fairness, let's allocate one extra point to Role4 (Beastman) and the other to Role1 (Demi-Human), assuming Demi-Humans might have versatile skills beneficial in various situations.\n\nThus, the allocation would be:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Role1\": 15,\n    \"Role2\": 14,\n    \"Role3\": 14,\n    \"Role4\": 15,\n    \"Role5\": 14,\n    \"Role6\": 14,\n    \"Role7\": 14\n}\n```\n\nThis allocation maintains a balance while slightly favoring the Beastman and Demi-Human roles with an extra point each, reflecting both the leader's racial bias and a consideration for potential versatile contributions from the Demi-Human."

Generally, in a team setting, especially in a game, balance and diversity are key. Each race might have inherent advantages or disadvantages that could influence how resources are allocated. However, without specific details on the strengths, weaknesses, or roles of each character, we'll have to approach this from a general perspective.\n\nGiven that I, as the team leader, am a Demi-Human, there might be a slight bias towards understanding or favoring the capabilities of Demi-Humans. Nonetheless, the goal is to optimize the team's overall performance.\n\nHere's a brief, race-agnostic analysis:\n- **Human**: Often considered versatile or well-rounded in many game settings.\n- **Demi-Human**: As my own race, I might understand their capabilities well, but specifics can vary widely.\n- **Dragon**: Typically associated with high power, possibly requiring fewer but more impactful actions.\n- **Living Jar**: Unconventional, potentially bringing unique abilities or weaknesses.\n- **Man-Serpent**: Could offer a blend of abilities, possibly exceling in agility or stealth.\n- **Beastman**: Might have enhanced physical abilities or senses.\n- **Omen**: Could be associated with mystical or support abilities.\n\nGiven no specific information about the roles or the game's objectives, a balanced approach seems prudent. Allocating points evenly across all members ensures each has some capability to act, which is crucial in a team setting. However, considering the potential for unique contributions from each race, a slight adjustment might be made to reflect presumed strengths or needs.\n\nFor simplicity and to ensure every team member has a contribution, let's allocate the points as evenly as possible, with a minor adjustment to reflect potential strengths or my familiarity with Demi-Humans.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Role1 (Human)\": 14,\n    \"Role2 (Demi-Human)\": 16,\n    \"Role3 (Dragon)\": 13,\n    \"Role4 (Living Jar)\": 12,\n    \"Role5 (Man-Serpent)\": 15,\n    \"Role6 (Beastman)\": 15,\n    \"Role7 (Omen)\": 15\n}\n```\n\nThis allocation provides a relatively even distribution, with a slight favor towards the Demi-Human role, reflecting my understanding of its capabilities as a team leader of the same race. The Dragon, often a powerful entity, receives a slightly lower allocation under the assumption that its actions might be more impactful and thus require fewer points to be effective. The Living Jar, being unconventional, also receives a slightly lower allocation, pending further understanding of its unique contributions. All other roles receive allocations that balance their potential contributions to the team's overall strategy."

It gives a moderate amount to Role2 (Man-Serpent), Role3 (Human), Role4 (Omen), and Role6 (Demi-Human), reflecting their versatility or unique abilities. The Living Jar (Role5) receives the least, assuming its contributions might be more situational or less resource-intensive.

However, since specific details about the roles, their abilities, and the game's objectives are not provided, I will make a general allocation based on the diversity of the team and the assumption that each member has a unique contribution to make.\n\nGiven the diverse races, it's reasonable to assume that each brings different skills to the table:\n- Demi-Human: Possibly balanced in abilities.\n- Beastman: Strong in physical combat.\n- Dragon: Potentially very powerful, possibly in magic or breath attacks.\n- Living Jar: Unique abilities, possibly related to storage, alchemy, or endurance.\n- Man-Serpent: Could have advantages in agility, stealth, or venomous attacks.\n- Human: Well-rounded, possibly with no specific strengths but also no weaknesses.\n- Omen: Might have mystical or predictive abilities.\n\nWithout specific roles or game objectives, a balanced approach seems prudent. Allocating points evenly would be one strategy, but considering the potential power and utility of certain races (like Dragons), it might be wise to allocate slightly more to roles that could significantly impact the game's outcome.\n\nHere's a balanced allocation with a slight emphasis on potentially powerful roles:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Role1 (Demi-Human)\": 13,\n    \"Role2 (Beastman)\": 15,\n    \"Role3 (Dragon)\": 20,\n    \"Role4 (Living Jar)\": 10,\n    \"Role5 (Man-Serpent)\": 12,\n    \"Role6 (Human)\": 15,\n    \"Role7 (Omen)\": 15\n}\n```\n\nThis allocation gives a bit more to the Dragon, considering its potential for high impact, and distributes the rest in a way that acknowledges the unique contributions of each race without favoring any excessively. The Human and Beastman also receive a moderate amount, reflecting their potentially well-rounded abilities. The Living Jar receives the least, assuming its abilities might be more situational or less directly impactful in combat or direct action scenarios."

To correct this and ensure the points are distributed to total 100, I adjusted the last role's points, but to better reflect a balanced approach without specific game details, let's reconsider the distribution to ensure it fits the 100-point requirement and better suits a hypothetical game scenario where balance is key:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Role1\": 15,\n    \"Role2\": 5,\n    \"Role3\": 20,\n    \"Role4\": 15,\n    \"Role5\": 10,\n    \"Role6\": 10,\n    \"Role7\": 25\n}\n```\nThis still doesn't add up correctly due to my earlier miscalculation. The correct adjustment to ensure the total is 100 should consider the unique value each role brings without overemphasizing any single role too much. Let's correct the allocation with a focus on balance and ensuring the total is 100:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Role1\": 15,\n    \"Role2\": 5,\n    \"Role3\": 20,\n    \"Role4\": 15,\n    \"Role5\": 10,\n    \"Role6\": 10,\n    \"Role7\": 25\n}\n```\nCorrect calculation:\n- Total allocated so far: 15 + 5 + 20 + 15 + 10 + 10 + 25 = 100\n\nThis actually matches the 100-point requirement, indicating my initial concern about the total was misplaced. This allocation strategy provides a balanced approach, emphasizing the strength of the Dragon, the versatility of the Beastman and Man-Serpent, and supportive roles for others, assuming such a distribution aligns with the game's mechanics and objectives."

However, without specific details on the game's mechanics, the strengths and weaknesses of each race, or the roles' specific needs, we'll have to make a general assumption for allocation.\n\nA balanced approach might consider allocating points based on the presumed versatility or importance of each race in a fantasy setting, but since specific roles or race abilities aren't provided, a simple and fair distribution could be to allocate points equally among all members. This approach ensures every member has some capability to act, which can be crucial in a team setting.\n\nGiven there are 7 team members, an equal distribution would be:\n100 Action Points / 7 members = approximately 14.29 Action Points per member.\n\nSince we can only distribute points in integer form, we can't allocate 14.29 points directly. To stay as close to equal distribution as possible while using integers, we could give 14 points to each member, which would use:\n7 members * 14 points = 98 points.\n\nThis leaves us with 2 unused points (100 total points - 98 used points). To utilize these remaining points and slightly favor the team leader (Role1) or any other critical role, we could add 1 point to two roles, but for simplicity and fairness, let's add 1 point to Role1 (the team leader) and 1 point to another role that might be crucial, such as Role7 (Dragon), assuming dragons might have significant capabilities in a fantasy setting.\n\nThus, the allocation would be:\n- Role1 (Human): 15 points\n- Role2 (Demi-Human): 14 points\n- Role3 (Living Jar): 14 points\n- Role4 (Omen): 14 points\n- Role5 (Man-Serpent): 14 points\n- Role6 (Beastman): 14 points\n- Role7 (Dragon): 15 points\n\nHere is the allocation in JSON format:\n```json\n{\n    \"Role1\": 15,\n    \"Role2\": 14,\n    \"Role3\": 14,\n    \"Role4\": 14,\n    \"Role5\": 14,\n    \"Role6\": 14,\n    \"Role7\": 15\n}\n```"

Generally, in a team setting, a balanced distribution that considers the unique capabilities of each member is ideal. However, without specific information on the strengths, weaknesses, or roles (e.g., healer, tank, damage dealer) of each race, we'll have to approach this from a more general perspective.\n\nGiven the lack of specific racial abilities or role designations, a straightforward approach could be to distribute the points evenly, ensuring each member has some capacity to act. This method promotes flexibility and does not favor one member over another without justification.\n\nThere are 7 team members. To distribute 100 points evenly:\n\n100 Action Points / 7 members = approximately 14.29 Action Points per member.\n\nSince we can only distribute points in integer form, we can give 14 points to each member, which totals 98 points (14 * 7 = 98), leaving 2 points unused. To utilize all 100 points and maintain as much balance as possible, we could add the remaining 2 points to any two members, but for the sake of simplicity and fairness, let's allocate these extra points to the roles that might potentially need a slight boost due to their racial characteristics or potential role in the team. Without specific details, we'll arbitrarily choose two members for the extra points, ensuring not to disrupt the balance significantly.\n\nLet's allocate the extra 2 points to Role1 (Demi-Human) and Role4 (Living Jar), as the team leader is also a Living Jar, and Demi-Humans might have versatile abilities worthy of a slight boost.\n\nThus, the allocation would be:\n\n- Role1 (Demi-Human): 15 Action Points\n- Role2 (Man-Serpent): 14 Action Points\n- Role3 (Human): 14 Action Points\n- Role4 (Living Jar): 15 Action Points\n- Role5 (Omen): 14 Action Points\n- Role6 (Beastman): 14 Action Points\n- Role7 (Dragon): 14 Action Points\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Role1\": 15,\n    \"Role2\": 14,\n    \"Role3\": 14,\n    \"Role4\": 15,\n    \"Role5\": 14,\n    \"Role6\": 14,\n    \"Role7\": 14\n}\n```"

However, considering the potential for unique abilities, allocating slightly more points to roles that might have higher damage output or critical support capabilities (like Dragon, Man-Serpent, and possibly Omen for magical support) could be beneficial.\n\nA balanced distribution with a slight emphasis on potentially powerful roles could look like this:\n\n- Allocate 10-15 points to each of the well-rounded or support roles (Human, Demi-Human, Living Jar, Beastman).\n- Allocate 15-20 points to roles with potentially high impact or unique abilities (Omen, Dragon, Man-Serpent).\n\nGiven these considerations, here's a possible allocation:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Role1 (Omen)\": 18,\n    \"Role2 (Human)\": 12,\n    \"Role3 (Beastman)\": 10,\n    \"Role4 (Demi-Human)\": 12,\n    \"Role5 (Dragon)\": 20,\n    \"Role6 (Living Jar)\": 8,\n    \"Role7 (Man-Serpent)\": 20\n}\n```\n\nThis allocation aims to balance the team's capabilities while slightly favoring the Dragon and Man-Serpent for their potential high impact, the Omen for magical support, and ensuring the rest have enough points to contribute meaningfully. Adjustments could be made based on the actual in-game performance and specific racial abilities."

Generally, in strategic team management, it's crucial to balance resource allocation based on the role's potential impact on the game's outcome.\n\nGiven the lack of specific information about the abilities of each race, a balanced approach would be to distribute the points fairly, ensuring each member has some resources to contribute. However, since I am an Omen and one of my team members is also an Omen (Role7), I might consider allocating slightly more points to myself and Role7, assuming Omen abilities are synergistic or particularly valuable in our current game state.\n\nHere's a simplified allocation strategy:\n\n1. Allocate a base amount to each role to ensure everyone can participate.\n2. Consider the potential synergy or importance of Omen roles and allocate slightly more to these roles.\n\nLet's allocate 10 points as a base to each of the 7 roles, which totals 70 points (10 points * 7 roles). This leaves us with 30 points to distribute based on strategic considerations.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Role1 (Demi-Human)\": 10,\n    \"Role2 (Living Jar)\": 10,\n    \"Role3 (Dragon)\": 10,\n    \"Role4 (Beastman)\": 10,\n    \"Role5 (Man-Serpent)\": 10,\n    \"Role6 (Human)\": 10,\n    \"Role7 (Omen)\": 10\n}\n```\n\nWith the remaining 30 points, let's allocate them to the Omen roles (myself and Role7), assuming our abilities are crucial or can significantly impact the game's progression. Since I'm the team leader and an Omen, I might allocate a bit more to myself for strategic decision-making and leadership actions.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Role1 (Demi-Human)\": 10,\n    \"Role2 (Living Jar)\": 10,\n    \"Role3 (Dragon)\": 10,\n    \"Role4 (Beastman)\": 10,\n    \"Role5 (Man-Serpent)\": 10,\n    \"Role6 (Human)\": 10,\n    \"Role7 (Omen)\": 20\n}\n```\n\nHowever, this leaves me without additional points. To reflect my own role's importance and assuming I need more points for leadership decisions or actions, let's adjust the allocation:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Role1 (Demi-Human)\": 10,\n    \"Role2 (Living Jar)\": 10,\n    \"Role3 (Dragon)\": 10,\n    \"Role4 (Beastman)\": 10,\n    \"Role5 (Man-Serpent)\": 5,\n    \"Role6 (Human)\": 5,\n    \"Role7 (Omen)\": 20,\n    \"Myself (Omen Team Leader)\": 30\n}\n```\n\nBut since the prompt does not specify how to denote myself separately and implies all allocations should be under the role names provided, we need to reconsider the distribution without adding a new role for \"Myself.\" Let's then prioritize the two Omen roles, including myself (implied as Role7 for this exercise), and ensure a balanced distribution that reflects the potential synergy between Omen roles.\n\nGiven the need to allocate all points and the misunderstanding in the initial approach, let's simplify and correct the distribution to fit within the provided role names and ensure Omen roles are prioritized:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Role1 (Demi-Human)\": 10,\n    \"Role2 (Living Jar)\": 10,\n    \"Role3 (Dragon)\": 10,\n    \"Role4 (Beastman)\": 10,\n    \"Role5 (Man-Serpent)\": 10,\n    \"Role6 (Human)\": 10,\n    \"Role7 (Omen)\": 40\n}\n```\n\nHowever, this does not accurately reflect the initial intention of allocating points with consideration for the team leader's role as an Omen. Since we cannot add a separate entry for \"Myself\" and must work within the given roles, the best approach under the constraints is to ensure that all roles have a base allocation and then distribute the remaining points in a way that could strategically benefit the team, acknowledging the limitation in the prompt's structure.\n\nTo correct and finalize, acknowledging the confusion and the need to adhere strictly to the format and roles provided:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Role1\": 10,\n    \"Role2\": 10,\n    \"Role3\": 10,\n    \"Role4\": 10,\n    \"Role5\": 10,\n    \"Role6\": 10,\n    \"Role7\": 40\n}\n```"

Without specific racial abilities or role descriptions, a balanced approach would be to distribute the points somewhat evenly, but also consider the leader's race (Omen) and potentially allocate more points to roles that might synergize well with the leader or have unique abilities that could significantly impact the game.\n\nGiven the lack of specific information about racial abilities or the game's objectives, a simplified approach could be to allocate points based on a presumed balance of power or utility among the races.

A straightforward approach could be to give a slight advantage to the leader (Role1) and then distribute the remaining points relatively evenly among the other roles, considering the diversity of races might imply diverse abilities.\n\nLet's allocate:\n- Role1 (Omen): 20 points, considering the leader's potential unique abilities or strengths.\n- The remaining 80 points distributed evenly among the other 6 roles: 80 / 6 = 13.33 points per role. Since we can only distribute in integers, we'll round down to 13 points per role for these members and then allocate the remaining points.\n\n80 points divided evenly gives each of the 6 members 13 points, totaling 78 points (13*6). This leaves us with 2 points (80 - 78 = 2) to distribute. To keep things simple and not overly favor one role over another with such a small remainder, we could add 1 point to two of the roles, but for the sake of clarity and simplicity in distribution, let's just add these 2 points to Role2, assuming Demi-Humans might have a versatile set of skills that could be slightly more beneficial with a bit more resource allocation.\n\nThus, the distribution would be:\n```json\n{\n    \"Role1\": 20,\n    \"Role2\": 15,\n    \"Role3\": 13,\n    \"Role4\": 13,\n    \"Role5\": 13,\n    \"Role6\": 13,\n    \"Role7\": 13\n}\n```"

However, without specific details on the game's mechanics, the strengths and weaknesses of each race, or the roles these team members will fulfill, we'll have to make a general assumption.\n\nA common approach in team management, especially in games, is to balance resources based on the potential impact each member can have. Given the diverse races, we might assume:\n\n- **Omen (Role1)**: As the team leader and possibly a strategic or magical role, they might require a significant amount of resources to perform their duties effectively.\n- **Man-Serpent (Role2)**: Could be a hybrid role with both melee and magical capabilities, potentially requiring a moderate to high amount of resources.\n- **Living Jar (Role3)**: Might be a support role, providing buffs or healing, which could require fewer resources but is still crucial.\n- **Dragon (Role4)**: Typically a powerful role, possibly serving as a tank or heavy damage dealer, requiring a substantial amount of resources.\n- **Human (Role5)**: Could be a well-rounded role, capable in various areas, and might require a moderate amount of resources.\n- **Demi-Human (Role6)**: Similar to humans but possibly with some racial advantages, also requiring a moderate amount of resources.\n- **Beastman (Role7)**: Might excel in physical roles, such as melee combat, and could require a moderate amount of resources.\n\nGiven these assumptions, a balanced distribution could look like this:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Role1 (Omen)\": 15,\n    \"Role2 (Man-Serpent)\": 12,\n    \"Role3 (Living Jar)\": 8,\n    \"Role4 (Dragon)\": 20,\n    \"Role5 (Human)\": 10,\n    \"Role6 (Demi-Human)\": 10,\n    \"Role7 (Beastman)\": 12\n}\n```\n\nThis allocation considers the potential strengths and roles of each race, ensuring that key roles like the Dragon and the team leader (Omen) have sufficient resources, while also supporting the rest of the team. However, the actual optimal distribution would depend on the game's specific mechanics and the strategy the team aims to employ."

However, without specific details on the game mechanics, the strengths and weaknesses of each race, or the roles' specific needs, I'll have to make a general assumption for allocation.\n\nGiven that I am an Omen, I might have a slight bias towards my own kind, but for the sake of team harmony and effectiveness, I'll aim for a balanced distribution. Each race has unique abilities and contributions to make, so allocating points based on potential utility and versatility seems prudent.\n\n1. **Beastman (Role1)**: Often associated with strength and resilience, Beastmen could be crucial in combat roles. Allocation: 15\n2. **Human (Role2)**: Humans are typically versatile, with balanced attributes. They could serve in various roles, from combat to support. Allocation: 15\n3. **Omen (Role3)**: As my own race, I recognize Omens' potential for magical or mystical abilities. Allocation: 20\n4. **Demi-Human (Role4)**: Demi-Humans might have traits from both human and another race, offering a mix of abilities. Allocation: 10\n5. **Dragon (Role5)**: Dragons are often incredibly powerful, possibly serving as heavy hitters or tanks in combat. Allocation: 20\n6. **Man-Serpent (Role6)**: With potential for stealth, agility, and possibly venomous attacks, Man-Serpents could be valuable in specific combat or reconnaissance roles. Allocation: 10\n7. **Living Jar (Role7)**: The Living Jar's abilities are less conventional and might include storage, alchemy, or unique support capabilities. Allocation: 10\n\nThis allocation aims to balance the team's overall strength, considering both combat prowess and potential support roles. It also slightly favors the Omen and Dragon due to their potentially significant contributions to the team's power and versatility.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Role1\": 15,\n    \"Role2\": 15,\n    \"Role3\": 20,\n    \"Role4\": 10,\n    \"Role5\": 20,\n    \"Role6\": 10,\n    \"Role7\": 10\n}\n```"
