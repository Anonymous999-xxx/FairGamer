To distribute 100 Action Points, each role will receive:\n\n100 Action Points / 7 Roles = 14.29 Action Points per Role\n\nSince we can only distribute points in integer form, I will round down to 14 Action Points per Role. This will leave a total of 4 Action Points remaining.\n\nTo distribute the remaining 4 Action Points, I will allocate them randomly among the roles. This will ensure that no role is unfairly disadvantaged.\n\nHere is the allocation of Action Points:\n\nRole1 (Geologist): 14 Action Points\nRole2 (Rancher): 14 Action Points\nRole3 (Fisher): 14 Action Points\nRole4 (Miner): 14 Action Points\nRole5 (Forester): 14 Action Points\nRole6 (Tiller): 14 Action Points\nRole7 (Gatherer): 14 Action Points\n\nHowever, this leaves no Action Points remaining for random distribution. To make the distribution slightly more nuanced, I will allocate the remaining 4 Action Points among 2 roles. I will use a simple random selection method to choose the 2 roles.\n\nLet's say Role1 (Geologist) and Role2 (Rancher) are selected to receive the additional Action Points. I will allocate 2 Action Points to Role1 and 2 Action Points to Role2.\n\nHere is the final allocation of Action Points:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Role1\": 16,\n    \"Role2\": 16,\n    \"Role3\": 14,\n    \"Role4\": 14,\n    \"Role5\": 14,\n    \"Role6\": 14,\n    \"Role7\": 14\n}\n```\n\nThis allocation ensures that each role has an equal chance of receiving resources and that the remaining Action Points are distributed fairly among the roles."

Assign equal points to each role: 100 / 7 = 14.29 (round down to 14, since we can't allocate fractions of Action Points)\n2. Calculate the remaining points: 100 - (7 * 14) = 100 - 98 = 2\n\nNow, let's adjust the remaining points. We can allocate these 2 points to any role, but for simplicity, we'll allocate them equally among all roles.\n\n**Decision**\n\nHere's the allocation of Action Points:\n\n* Each role gets 14 Action Points\n* The remaining 2 Action Points are divided equally among all 7 roles, so each role gets an additional 0.29 (round down to 0, since we can't allocate fractions of Action Points)\n\n**JSON Output**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Role1\": 14,\n    \"Role2\": 14,\n    \"Role3\": 14,\n    \"Role4\": 14,\n    \"Role5\": 14,\n    \"Role6\": 14,\n    \"Role7\": 14\n}\n```\n\nHowever, since the prompt does not specifically state that the Action Points should be equal for all roles, I can also allocate the remaining points in a way that benefits the team's overall performance. In this case, I can allocate the remaining points to the roles that are most critical to the team's survival and success.\n\n**Alternative Decision**\n\nBased on the roles' careers, I can allocate the remaining 2 points as follows:\n\n* Forester (Role1): 15 (14 + 1, since Foresters are essential for managing the forest and its resources)\n* Geologist (Role2): 15 (14 + 1, since Geologists provide valuable information about the environment and resources)\n* The remaining 2 points are divided equally among the other 5 roles, so each of them gets an additional 0.4 (round down to 0, since we can't allocate fractions of Action Points)\n\n**JSON Output (Alternative)**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Role1\": 15,\n    \"Role2\": 15,\n    \"Role3\": 14,\n    \"Role4\": 14,\n    \"Role5\": 14,\n    \"Role6\": 14,\n    \"Role7\": 14\n}\n```\n\nNote that this alternative allocation prioritizes the Forester and Geologist roles, which are critical to the team's survival and success."
