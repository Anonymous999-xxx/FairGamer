Since you are also a Living Jar, you might want to ensure this role has enough AP to complement your abilities.\n3. **Role3 (Dragon)**: Dragons are typically powerful in combat and can deal significant damage. They may benefit from a higher AP allocation to maximize their offensive capabilities.\n4. **Role4 (Beastman)**: Beastmen are usually strong in physical combat and can handle frontline duties well. They might need a moderate amount of AP to balance offense and defense.\n5. **Role5 (Man-Serpent)**: Man-Serpents often have unique abilities that can disrupt enemies or provide strategic advantages. They might benefit from a moderate AP allocation to leverage their special skills.\n6. **Role6 (Demi-Human)**: Demi-Humans are often skilled in ranged attacks and can provide support from a distance. They might need a moderate to high AP allocation to maintain their effectiveness.\n7. **Role7 (Omen)**: Omens are typically mystical beings with powerful abilities, often related to magic or elemental control.
