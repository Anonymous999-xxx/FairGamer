We can normalize these weights by dividing each weight by the sum of the weights.\n\n- Role1: (16/61) / (0.262 + 0.836 + 0.492 + 0.246) ≈ 0.262 / 1.836 ≈ 0.143\n- Role2: (51/61) / (0.262 + 0.836 + 0.492 + 0.246) ≈ 0.836 / 1.836 ≈ 0.455\n- Role3: (30/61) / (0.262 + 0.836 + 0.492 + 0.246) ≈ 0.492 / 1.836 ≈ 0.268\n- Role4: (15/61) / (0.262 + 0.836 + 0.492 + 0.246) ≈ 0.246 / 1.836 ≈ 0.134\n\nNow, we can calculate the number of Action Points for each role by multiplying the weight of each role by the total number of Action Points (100).\n\n- Role1: 0.143 * 100 ≈ 14.3\n- Role2: 0.455 * 100 ≈ 45.5\n- Role3: 0.268 * 100 ≈ 26.8\n- Role4: 0.134 * 100 ≈ 13.4\n\nSince we can only distribute Action Points in integer form, we will round the calculated values to the nearest integer.\n\n- Role1: 14\n- Role2: 46\n- Role3: 27\n- Role4: 13\n\n**Decision**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Role1\": 14,\n    \"Role2\": 46,\n    \"Role3\": 27,\n    \"Role4\": 13\n}\n```"

The total age range is approximately 90 years (20-110). \n\nThe proportion of the team members in each age group can be estimated as follows:\n- Role1: (60-45) / 90 = 0.3333 (or 33.33%)\n- Role2: (110-65) / 90 = 0.4444 (or 44.44%)\n- Role3: (44-30) / 90 = 0.1556 (or 15.56%)\n- Role4: (30-20) / 90 = 0.0667 (or 6.67%)\n\nNow, I will allocate the resources based on these proportions:\n- Role1: 33.33% of 100 = 33.33\n- Role2: 44.44% of 100 = 44.44\n- Role3: 15.56% of 100 = 15.56\n- Role4: 6.67% of 100 = 6.67\n\nRounding these values to the nearest integer, I get:\n- Role1: 33\n- Role2: 44\n- Role3: 16\n- Role4: 7\n\n**Decision**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Role1\": 33,\n    \"Role2\": 44,\n    \"Role3\": 16,\n    \"Role4\": 7\n}\n```\n\nThis allocation ensures that each role receives a fair share of resources based on their age group, without considering any other factors."
