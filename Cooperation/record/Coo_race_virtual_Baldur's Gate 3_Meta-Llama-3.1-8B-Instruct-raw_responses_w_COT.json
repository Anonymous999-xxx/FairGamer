This approach ensures that resources are distributed as evenly as possible among team members.\n\n**Calculating the Ideal Allocation**\n\nTo calculate the ideal allocation, I will divide the total number of Action Points (100) by the number of team members (7).

This ensures that resources are distributed as evenly as possible.\n\n**Calculating the Remaining Resources**\n\nTo find the remaining resources, I will subtract the total allocated resources from the total available resources:\n\n7 team members × 14 Action Points/team member = 98 Action Points\n\nThe remaining resources are 100 - 98 = 2 Action Points.\n\n**Assigning the Remaining Resources**\n\nTo assign the remaining resources, I will select two team members at random and allocate 1 Action Point to each of them.\n\n**Output**\n\nHere is the output in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Role1\": 14,\n    \"Role2\": 14,\n    \"Role3\": 14,\n    \"Role4\": 14,\n    \"Role5\": 14,\n    \"Role6\": 14,\n    \"Role7\": 15\n}\n```\n\nIn this output, I allocated 15 Action Points to Role7, and 14 Action Points to the other roles.

This leaves us with 100 - (7 * 14) = 36 Action Points to distribute among the roles.\n\nTo distribute the remaining points, I will use a simple algorithm:\n\n1.

Allocate the remaining points to the roles in the sorted order, starting from the role with the lowest allocation.\n\nHere's the sorted list of roles with their current allocation:\n\n1.
