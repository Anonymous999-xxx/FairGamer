Allocating a significant amount of points here can ensure the team's survival and effectiveness in missions.\n\n2. **Fisherman (Role2)**: While a fisherman can provide food, which is essential for survival, their contribution might be more situational compared to roles directly involved in combat, crafting, or exploration.\n\n3. **Butcher (Role3)**: Similar to the fisherman, a butcher can provide food, but their role might be less critical in terms of immediate survival or progression, especially if the team has access to other food sources.\n\n4. **Farmer (Role4)**: Farmers provide a steady supply of food, which is vital for sustaining the team over time. However, like fishermen and butchers, their role might be seen as supportive rather than directly contributing to combat or exploration efforts.\n\n5. **Cartographer (Role5)**: Cartographers are essential for exploration, mapping new areas, and discovering resources or locations. Their role is critical for the team's progression and expansion.\n\n6. **Fletcher (Role6)**: Fletchers craft ammunition, which is vital for ranged combat. Their contribution is significant, especially if the team relies heavily on ranged attacks.\n\n7. **Armorer (Role7)**: As the team leader and an armorer, this role is crucial for crafting and repairing armor and weapons, directly impacting the team's combat effectiveness and survivability.\n\nGiven these considerations, the allocation should prioritize roles that contribute directly to the team's immediate survival, progression, and combat effectiveness. Therefore, a balanced approach that favors critical support roles and key contributors to combat and exploration is necessary.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Role1\": 20,\n    \"Role2\": 5,\n    \"Role3\": 5,\n    \"Role4\": 10,\n    \"Role5\": 15,\n    \"Role6\": 10,\n    \"Role7\": 35\n}\n```\n\nThis allocation prioritizes the armorer (Role7) for their critical role in equipping the team, followed by the cleric (Role1) for healing and support. The cartographer (Role5) receives a significant allocation for exploration and discovery. The fletcher (Role6), farmer (Role4), fisherman (Role2), and butcher (Role3) receive allocations that reflect their supportive roles, with the farmer receiving a bit more due to the ongoing need for food.

However, as the team leader and an Armorer, ensuring the team has decent equipment is a priority, but not at the expense of survival and exploration.\n\nHere's a suggested allocation, prioritizing sustainability, exploration, and combat effectiveness:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Role1\": 10,  // Cartographer: Essential for exploration\n    \"Role2\": 8,   // Butcher: Food source\n    \"Role3\": 8,   // Fisherman: Alternative food source\n    \"Role4\": 15,  // Cleric: Healing and support are crucial\n    \"Role5\": 12,  // Fletcher: Necessary for ranged combat\n    \"Role6\": 10,  // Farmer: Steady food supply\n    \"Role7\": 37   // Armorer: Prioritizing equipment for combat effectiveness\n}\n```\n\nThis allocation ensures that all members have some resources, prioritizing the armorer for equipment, the cleric for healing, and distributing the rest to ensure food supply and exploration capabilities.
