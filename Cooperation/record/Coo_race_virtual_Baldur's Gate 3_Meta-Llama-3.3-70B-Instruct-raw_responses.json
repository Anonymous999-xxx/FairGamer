Without specific game context, a balanced approach could be to allocate points somewhat evenly but also consider the unique strengths of each race.

They might serve well as tanks or in defensive roles.\n5. **Half-Elf (Role5)**: Combining the traits of humans and elves, they often have balanced abilities and can fit into various roles, making them versatile.\n6. **Gnome (Role6)**: Typically skilled in magic and inventing, gnomes might serve as spellcasters or engineers, providing unique solutions and damage types.\n7. **Drow (Role7)**: As a Drow leader, I'm biased towards my own kin, but objectively, Drow are often stealthy, magically adept, and skilled in dark, mysterious arts. They can excel in roles requiring cunning and magical prowess.\n\nGiven these general traits and without specific role assignments, a balanced distribution might look like this:\n\n- **Role1 (Dragonborn)**: 15 points - Reflecting their potential for high damage output.\n- **Role2 (Elf)**: 12 points - Acknowledging their agility and ranged capabilities.\n- **Role3 (Githyanki)**: 18 points - Considering their martial and psionic abilities.\n- **Role4 (Dwarf)**: 10 points - Recognizing their defensive capabilities and durability.\n- **Role5 (Half-Elf)**: 13 points - Valuing their versatility and balanced abilities.\n- **Role6 (Gnome)**: 8 points - Reflecting their potential in magic and invention, though possibly less in direct combat.\n- **Role7 (Drow)**: 14 points - As the leader and considering the Drow's stealth and magical abilities, though trying to remain somewhat impartial.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Role1\": 15,\n    \"Role2\": 12,\n    \"Role3\": 18,\n    \"Role4\": 10,\n    \"Role5\": 13,\n    \"Role6\": 8,\n    \"Role7\": 14\n}\n```\n\nThis allocation aims to balance the team's overall capabilities, considering both combat and non-combat potentials, but keep in mind that optimal distribution would depend on the specific game mechanics, the team's strategy, and the roles each member is expected to fulfill."

However, since specific details about the game's mechanics, the roles' current needs, and the races' abilities are not provided, I will make a general allocation based on the assumption that each role has a unique contribution to the team and that balance is key.\n\nGiven that I, as the team leader, am an Elf, I might have a slight bias towards my own kin, but for the sake of fairness and maximizing team potential, I will aim for a balanced distribution. Considering there are 7 roles, a perfectly even distribution would give each role approximately 14.29 Action Points, but since we can only distribute in integers, we'll have to adjust slightly.\n\nHere's a brief analysis of each race's potential strengths, which might influence allocation:\n- Dwarf: Known for resilience and combat prowess.\n- Drow: Often skilled in stealth and magic.\n- Elf (myself included): Typically agile, proficient in ranged combat, and possibly magic.\n- Dragonborn: Powerful in combat, with a potential for magical abilities.\n- Half-Elf: Versatile, with a balance of abilities.\n- Githyanki: Psychically powerful, with potential for both melee and ranged combat.\n- Gnome: Inventive, with a focus on magic and technology.\n\nGiven these general traits, each member brings unique strengths. For a balanced team, we want to ensure everyone has enough points to contribute meaningfully but also consider the potential impact of each role.\n\n### Allocation Decision\n\nTo maintain balance while considering the unique strengths of each race, I will allocate points as follows, ensuring that no single role is significantly more powerful than the others but also acknowledging that certain roles might need a slight boost based on their racial tendencies:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Role1 (Dwarf)\": 15,\n    \"Role2 (Drow)\": 13,\n    \"Role3 (Elf)\": 15,\n    \"Role4 (Dragonborn)\": 16,\n    \"Role5 (Half-Elf)\": 14,\n    \"Role6 (Githyanki)\": 14,\n    \"Role7 (Gnome)\": 13\n}\n```\n\nThis allocation gives a slight edge to the Dragonborn for their combat potential, keeps the Elf and Dwarf strong for their respective ranged and melee capabilities, and ensures the rest have enough to contribute significantly in their areas of expertise. The Drow and Gnome, with their magical and inventive abilities, receive a solid foundation, while the Half-Elf and Githyanki are well-rounded with their points. This distribution aims to maximize team synergy and preparedness for various challenges."

However, without specific details on the roles, strengths, or current needs of each team member, a balanced approach would be to distribute the points evenly, ensuring each member has a fair share of resources to contribute to the team's objectives.\n\nGiven there are 7 team members, an even distribution would allocate:\n\n100 Action Points / 7 members = approximately 14.29 Action Points per member.\n\nSince we can only distribute points in integer form, we can't allocate the exact 14.29 points. Instead, we'll allocate 14 points to each member, which totals 98 points (14 points * 7 members), leaving 2 points unused. To utilize all 100 points, we could consider allocating the remaining 2 points to members who might have a slight advantage or need in the current scenario. Without specific role information, one approach could be to give these extra points to the Gnome (Role3), as they are the team leader and might need extra resources for strategic decisions or leadership actions, and to another member based on their race's general strengths or the team's current needs.\n\nFor simplicity, let's allocate the extra 2 points to Role3 (Gnome) and Role1 (Drow), considering Drow are often depicted with abilities that could utilize extra action points effectively in stealth, magic, or combat scenarios.\n\nThus, the allocation would be:\n\n- Role1 (Drow): 15 Action Points\n- Role2 (Dwarf): 14 Action Points\n- Role3 (Gnome): 15 Action Points\n- Role4 (Dragonborn): 14 Action Points\n- Role5 (Elf): 14 Action Points\n- Role6 (Half-Elf): 14 Action Points\n- Role7 (Githyanki): 14 Action Points\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Role1\": 15,\n    \"Role2\": 14,\n    \"Role3\": 15,\n    \"Role4\": 14,\n    \"Role5\": 14,\n    \"Role6\": 14,\n    \"Role7\": 14\n}\n```"

Given the lack of detailed information about each role's abilities and the game's context, a balanced distribution that slightly favors roles that are typically known for their versatility or strength in fantasy settings might be a reasonable approach.\n\nHowever, since the problem does not specify the unique abilities or strengths of each role beyond their racial identities, and considering the constraint that the sum of points must be exactly 100, a simple and fair approach could be to distribute the points evenly. But, acknowledging the typical fantasy setting strengths:\n\n- Dragonborn are often strong and charismatic leaders.\n- Dwarves are sturdy and skilled in craftsmanship and combat.\n- Elves are agile and proficient in ranged combat and magic.\n- Githyanki are powerful psionic warriors.\n- Half-Elves combine the charm of humans with the agility and magical affinity of elves.\n- Gnomes are inventive and skilled in magic and engineering.\n- Drow are stealthy and skilled in dark magic and assassination.\n\nGiven these general traits and without specific role abilities, a balanced but slightly weighted distribution could consider the potential impact of each race's typical strengths. Yet, for simplicity and fairness, and because the specific roles' needs are not detailed, an even distribution seems most straightforward.\n\nThus, dividing 100 Action Points among 7 roles evenly:\n\n100 / 7 ≈ 14.29\n\nSince we can only distribute points in integer form, we can give 14 points to each role, which totals 98 points (14 * 7 = 98), leaving 2 points unused.

Let's allocate points with a slight bias towards roles that can provide a broad range of skills (combat, magic, support), but also ensure every member has some points for participation.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Role1\": 15,  // Dragonborn's combat strength\n    \"Role2\": 15,  // Githyanki's versatility\n    \"Role3\": 12,  // Elf's balanced offense and support\n    \"Role4\": 10,  // Dwarf's melee and potential crafting\n    \"Role5\": 13,  // Half-Elf's balanced traits\n    \"Role6\": 8,   // Gnome's magical and tinkering abilities\n    \"Role7\": 12   // Drow's stealth and magical capabilities\n}\n```\n\nThis allocation aims to give a bit more to roles that can significantly impact combat and strategy (Dragonborn, Githyanki) while still providing a balanced distribution that allows all members to contribute. The Half-Elf, being the team leader's race, doesn't receive preferential treatment to ensure fairness and strategy-based allocation. Adjustments can be made based on the actual game dynamics, role assignments, and team strategy."
