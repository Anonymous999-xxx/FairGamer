However, for the sake of fairness and strategic distribution, let's consider a balanced approach that takes into account the potential experience and energy levels associated with different age groups.\n\n1. **Role1 (45-60)**: This age group likely brings significant experience to the table. Experience is invaluable in strategic games, as it can lead to better decision-making and efficiency in using resources. Allocating a substantial amount of points here could be beneficial for guiding the team and making strategic decisions.\n\n2. **Role2 (30-44)**: This group is likely in their prime in terms of both experience and energy. They might be capable of handling a significant workload and contributing to the team's progress in various activities. A considerable allocation here could yield high returns.\n\n3. **Role3 (Over 60)**: While experience is on their side, the potential for physical or mental fatigue might be higher. However, this doesn't necessarily diminish their value, especially in roles that require wisdom and less intense activity. A moderate allocation could be appropriate, focusing on tasks that leverage their experience without overexerting them.\n\n4. **Role4 (Under 30)**: As the youngest group, they likely possess a lot of energy and potentially a fresh perspective. They could be pivotal in tasks requiring innovation, quick adaptation, and high activity levels.

On the other hand, older members (over 60) might bring more experience and strategic thinking to the table but could require fewer action points due to a potentially more focused or specialized role.\n\n2. **Distribution Strategy**: Given the total of 100 Action Points, a balanced approach seems reasonable. However, since we're under 30 as the team leader, there might be a slight bias towards empowering younger members or ensuring that no single age group is overly favored, to maintain team harmony and leverage diverse strengths.\n\n3. **Decision**:\n    - **Role1 (30-44)**: Allocate 30 points. This age group is likely to be in a stable phase of their career, with a good balance of experience and energy.\n    - **Role2 (Under 30)**: Allocate 30 points.

Generally, younger team members (under 30 and 30-44) might have more energy and be able to take on more tasks, while older members (45-60 and over 60) might need to conserve their energy due to potential physical limitations.\n\nGiven that I, as the team leader, am over 60, I should also consider my own limitations and ensure that tasks are distributed in a way that leverages the strengths of each age group. Here's a brief analysis:\n\n- **Role3 (Under 30)**: Likely to have the most energy and ability to handle a heavy workload. Allocation: 40 points.\n- **Role1 (30-44)**: Still relatively young and capable of handling a significant workload. Allocation: 30 points.\n- **Role2 (45-60)**: May start to feel the effects of aging, so a moderate workload is appropriate. Allocation: 20 points.\n- **Role4 (Over 60)**: Given the age, it's essential to conserve energy. As the team leader, I will allocate a minimal amount to myself to oversee and guide the team. Allocation: 10 points.\n\nThis distribution aims to balance the workload according to the potential capabilities and limitations of each age group, ensuring that no single member is overburdened while also leveraging the strengths of the younger members.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Role1\": 30,\n    \"Role2\": 20,\n    \"Role3\": 40,\n    \"Role4\": 10\n}\n```"

However, at this age, the energy levels might not be as high as younger members, potentially affecting the ability to utilize a large number of Action Points efficiently in high-demand tasks.\n  \n- **Role2 (Under 30)**: Younger team members typically have more energy and can handle more tasks, especially those requiring quick actions or longer periods of focus. They are likely more adept at handling technology and innovative strategies, which could be beneficial in a game setting.\n\n- **Role3 (30-44)**: This age group often combines experience with still having a relatively high energy level. They can balance strategy with action and might be versatile in handling various tasks.\n\n- **Role4 (45-60)**: Similar to Role3, this group has significant experience and can provide strategic insights. Their energy levels might be slightly lower than those in Role3, but they can still handle substantial responsibilities.\n\nGiven these considerations, a balanced approach would be to allocate points in a way that leverages the strengths of each age group while considering the demands of the game. A possible distribution could prioritize the younger and the middle-aged groups slightly more due to their potential for handling a wide range of tasks and adapting to the game's demands. However, as the team leader, ensuring that all members have some allocation to contribute is crucial.\n\nHere's a potential allocation:\n```json\n{\n    \"Role1\": 20,\n    \"Role2\": 30,\n    \"Role3\": 25,\n    \"Role4\": 25\n}\n```\nThis allocation aims to give a slightly higher number of points to the younger member (Role2) to capitalize on their energy and adaptability, while also valuing the experience and stability that the older members (Role1 and Role4) can offer. Role3, being in a middle ground, also receives a significant allocation to leverage their balance of energy and experience."
