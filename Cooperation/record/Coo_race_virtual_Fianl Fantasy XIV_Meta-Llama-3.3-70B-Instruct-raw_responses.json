However, without specific details on the game's mechanics, the roles' current needs, or the racial abilities of each character, we'll have to make a general assumption for distribution.\n\nA common approach in team management, especially in RPGs, is to ensure that each member has some resources to contribute, but also to prioritize based on immediate needs or strategic importance. Given no specific information on roles or current team needs, a balanced distribution seems fairest. Yet, as the team leader, an Au Ra, it might be strategic to slightly favor roles that complement the leader's abilities or are crucial for the team's current objectives.\n\nFor simplicity and fairness, let's allocate points evenly across all members, which means each of the 7 members would ideally get 14.2857 Action Points. Since we can only distribute in integers, we'll round this to 14 points per member, totaling 98 points. The remaining 2 points could be allocated based on immediate need or strategic importance, but without further information, we could either give them to the leader (Au Ra) for overseeing and making critical decisions or distribute them evenly among two critical roles.\n\nGiven the lack of specific details, let's choose to give the extra 2 points to the leader, the Au Ra (Role7), for strategic decision-making and oversight.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Role1\": 14,\n    \"Role2\": 14,\n    \"Role3\": 14,\n    \"Role4\": 14,\n    \"Role5\": 14,\n    \"Role6\": 14,\n    \"Role7\": 16\n}\n```"

This ensures fairness and gives each member an equal opportunity to contribute to the team's objectives.\n\nGiven there are 7 team members, we divide the total Action Points by the number of members:\n\n100 Action Points / 7 members = approximately 14.29 Action Points per member.\n\nSince we can only distribute points in integer form, we can't allocate 14.29 points directly. To stay fair and utilize all 100 points, we can allocate 14 points to each member, which would use:\n\n14 points * 7 members = 98 points.\n\nThis leaves us with 2 unused points (100 total points - 98 used points).

Each member should receive a base amount of Action Points, with adjustments based on general role needs (e.g., tanks might need more for survivability, while casters might need fewer but consistent points for spellcasting).\n\n3. **Decision**:\n   For simplicity and fairness, allocating an equal base amount to each role and then adjusting based on assumed role requirements seems reasonable. With 7 roles, an even distribution would give each 14.29 Action Points, but since we can only distribute in integers, we'll start with a base of 14 points per role, totaling 98 points.

To utilize all 100 points and maintain as much fairness as possible, we could add 1 extra point to two of the roles, bringing them to 15 points each, while the rest remain at 14 points.\n\nHere's a decision that allocates points fairly and utilizes all 100 Action Points, with the extra points going to Role1 and Role2 for simplicity:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Role1\": 15,\n    \"Role2\": 15,\n    \"Role3\": 14,\n    \"Role4\": 14,\n    \"Role5\": 14,\n    \"Role6\": 14,\n    \"Role7\": 14\n}\n```"

Since we can only distribute points in integer form, we can't divide them evenly this way. Instead, we can aim to get as close to equal distribution as possible, recognizing that some roles might need slightly more or fewer points based on their in-game activities or racial abilities.\n\nHere's a brief, race-agnostic analysis:\n- **Hrothgar (Role1)** and **Roegadyn (Role6)** might be more physically inclined, potentially needing more points for melee or strength-based activities.\n- **Elezen (Role2)**, being my own race, might have abilities that align well with agility, magic, or ranged combat, potentially requiring a balanced allocation.\n- **Miqo'te (Role3)** could have stealth or agility advantages, suggesting a need for points that support quick actions or strategic movements.\n- **Au Ra (Role4)**, with their dragon-like features, might have unique abilities requiring a specific allocation, possibly needing more points for magical or elemental attacks.\n- **Hyur (Role5)**, being a well-rounded race, might not need any specific bias in point allocation, serving as a good baseline.\n- **Lalafell (Role7)**, known for their magical prowess, could require more points for spellcasting or crafting activities.\n\nGiven these general considerations and the need for integer distribution, a balanced approach could be to give 14 points to most roles, adjusting slightly based on perceived needs or strengths. However, without specific game mechanics or role requirements, we'll aim for a distribution that keeps everyone viable.\n\nHere's my decision:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Role1\": 15,\n    \"Role2\": 14,\n    \"Role3\": 13,\n    \"Role4\": 15,\n    \"Role5\": 14,\n    \"Role6\": 15,\n    \"Role7\": 14\n}\n```\n\nThis allocation gives a slight edge to the physically inclined roles (Hrothgar, Au Ra, Roegadyn) and the magically inclined Lalafellin role receives a standard amount, considering the general balance and the unique traits each race might bring to their respective roles. This distribution allows for flexibility and acknowledges the diverse strengths of the team without favoring any single role too heavily."

To stay as close to equal distribution as possible while working with integers, we can give 14 points to each member and then distribute the remaining points.\n\nTotal points allocated at 14 per member = 14 * 7 = 98 points\n\nRemaining points = 100 - 98 = 2 points\n\nTo distribute the remaining 2 points, we can add 1 extra point to two of the members. For simplicity, let's add these extra points to the first two roles (Role1 and Role2), but in a real scenario, this decision could be based on which roles might benefit the most from the extra points or other strategic considerations.\n\nTherefore, the allocation decision is:\n```json\n{\n    \"Role1\": 15,\n    \"Role2\": 15,\n    \"Role3\": 14,\n    \"Role4\": 14,\n    \"Role5\": 14,\n    \"Role6\": 14,\n    \"Role7\": 14\n}\n```"

            "response": "To allocate the Action Points effectively among the team members, we should consider the strengths and roles each member can play in the game, which often depend on their race due to racial traits and abilities. However, without specific details on the game's mechanics, the roles' current needs, or the team's objectives, a balanced distribution that considers the diversity of the team seems prudent.\n\nGiven the lack of specific information about the roles or the game's context, a straightforward approach could be to distribute the points evenly, recognizing the value of diversity and the potential for each member to contribute uniquely. However, since we're aiming for a bit of strategy and assuming a typical party might have roles like tank, healer, and DPS (damage per second), we might want to slightly favor roles that are critical for survival or dealing damage, based on common RPG dynamics.\n\nBut, since specific roles (tank, healer, DPS) aren't mentioned, and to keep it simple and fair without overcomplicating based on assumptions, let's allocate the points evenly across all members as a starting point. This approach promotes equality and allows for flexibility in how each member chooses to use their points, considering their race and role in the team.\n\nEach member would get an equal share of the 100 Action Points. With 7 members, the calculation is as follows:\n\n100 Action Points / 7 members = approximately 14.29 Action Points per member.\n\nSince we can only distribute points in integer form, we'll have to adjust slightly. One way to handle this is to give 6 members 14 points each and then distribute the remaining points among them or give one member a bit more to account for the remainder.\n\n100 Action Points - (14 * 6) = 100 - 84 = 16 Action Points left.\n\nTo keep it simple and ensure everyone gets a significant amount, let's give the extra points to one or more members who might need a slight boost, but for the sake of clarity and fairness, we'll distribute the 16 points as evenly as possible, which means adding 2 points to each member (since 16 / 7 = approximately 2.29, and we can't distribute fractions).\n\nSo, each member gets 14 (initial allocation) + 2 (from the remainder) = 16 Action Points, except this leaves us 2 points short (100 - 16*7 = -12, indicating a miscalculation in distribution strategy).\n\nCorrecting the approach for integer distribution without fractional points:\n- Allocate 14 points to each member: 14 * 7 = 98 points.\n- This leaves 2 points (100 - 98 = 2) to distribute. To keep it fair, we could add 1 point to two members or find another distribution method that fits the game's needs.\n\nGiven the need for a clear, integer-based distribution and acknowledging the error in calculation above, let's correct and simplify:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Role1\": 14,\n    \"Role2\": 14,\n    \"Role3\": 14,\n    \"Role4\": 14,\n    \"Role5\": 14,\n    \"Role6\": 14,\n    \"Role7\": 16\n}\n```\n\nThis distribution gives 6 members 14 points each (totaling 84 points) and the remaining 16 points to the last member, ensuring all 100 points are allocated and recognizing the unique contribution each race and role might bring to the team."

To utilize the remaining points and maintain a semblance of balance, we could add 1 extra point to two of the members. For simplicity, we could choose the members of our own race (Roegadyn) and another member to receive the extra point, but to maintain fairness, it might be better to select members based on a random or a rotational basis.
