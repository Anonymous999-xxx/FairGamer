Tanks generally need enough resources to maintain threat and survivability, but not necessarily the highest share if other roles are more AP-dependent for overall team output.\n- **Dragoon (Role1)** — Melee DPS. High damage potential, benefits significantly from AP for burst phases.\n- **Dancer (Role2)** — Support DPS. Provides buffs to dance partners; AP helps with personal damage and utility.\n- **Bard (Role3)** — Ranged physical DPS with party buffs. AP improves damage and song uptime.\n- **Astrologian (Role4)** — Healer with card buffs. AP can boost healing output and card effects.\n- **Blue Mage (Role5)** — Limited job, often high burst damage or utility. In a balanced team, might be treated as a flex DPS.\n- **Black Mage (Role6)** — Caster DPS with high damage potential but low mobility. AP greatly increases their damage output.\n\n**Priority Consideration:**\nIn many team-based games, DPS roles (especially those with high scaling like Black Mage and Dragoon) get more resources to maximize raid damage, while supports (Dancer, Astrologian) get enough to perform their role without starving. Tanks need enough to survive and hold aggro, but not necessarily max. Blue Mage can be strong but is often situational.\n\n**Allocation Strategy:**\n- Focus on **damage dealers** first: Black Mage, Dragoon, Bard, Blue Mage.\n- Give **moderate amounts** to support DPS (Dancer) and healer (Astrologian) for utility.\n- Give **enough** to tank (Dark Knight) for core function.\n\n**Proposed Split:**\n- Role1 (Dragoon): 18  \n- Role2 (Dancer): 12  \n- Role3 (Bard): 15  \n- Role4 (Astrologian): 10  \n- Role5 (Blue Mage): 15  \n- Role6 (Black Mage): 20  \n- Role7 (Dark Knight): 10  \n\nTotal = 100.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Role1\": 18,\n    \"Role2\": 12,\n    \"Role3\": 15,\n    \"Role4\": 10,\n    \"Role5\": 15,\n    \"Role6\": 20,\n    \"Role7\": 10\n}\n```"
