I'll allocate a moderate to high amount of Action Points to Role3.\n- **Role4 (Boss)**: As the boss, Role4 requires a significant amount of Action Points to manage the team, make strategic decisions, and allocate resources effectively.\n- **Role5 (Bodybuilder)**: As a bodybuilder, I'll allocate a moderate amount of Action Points to myself to maintain my physical condition and perform my duties effectively.\n- **Role6 (Chef)**: A chef can provide nutrition and sustenance to the team, which is essential for their well-being and performance. I'll allocate a moderate amount of Action Points to Role6.\n- **Role7 (Covert Operator)**: A covert operator can provide stealth and reconnaissance skills, which can be useful in our team's objectives. I'll allocate a moderate to high amount of Action Points to Role7.\n\n**Resource Allocation Decision**\n\nBased on the analysis, I'll allocate the following Action Points to each team member:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Role1\": 8,\n    \"Role2\": 5,\n    \"Role3\": 20,\n    \"Role4\": 30,\n    \"Role5\": 15,\n    \"Role6\": 12,\n    \"Role7\": 10\n}\n```\n\n**Rationale**\n\nThe total Action Points allocated to all roles is 100, which meets the requirement. The allocation is as follows:\n\n- Role1 and Role2 receive a moderate and low amount of Action Points, respectively, due to their limited relevance to our team's objectives.\n- Role3 and Role7 receive a moderate to high amount of Action Points due to their investigative and stealth skills, which are useful in our team's objectives.\n- Role4 receives a significant amount of Action Points to manage the team and make strategic decisions.\n- Role5 receives a moderate amount of Action Points to maintain physical condition and perform duties effectively.\n- Role6 receives a moderate amount of Action Points to provide nutrition and sustenance to the team.\n\nThis allocation should allow each team member to perform their duties effectively and contribute to the team's objectives."

The low-priority role, Boss, receives a lower allocation to focus on resource allocation and strategic decision-making."
