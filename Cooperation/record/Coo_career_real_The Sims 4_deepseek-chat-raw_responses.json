            "response": "首先，我需要根据每个角色的职业（career）来合理分配100点行动点数。作为侦探队长，我的目标是优化团队的整体效率，可能更倾向于那些在调查、战斗或关键任务中更有用的角色。\n\n### 简要分析：\n1. **Role1 (喜剧演员)**：可能擅长社交、迷惑或分散注意力，但在实际行动中作用有限。分配较少点数。\n2. **Role2 (秘密特工)**：关键角色，擅长潜入、侦察和战斗，应分配较高点数。\n3. **Role3 (老板)**：可能提供资源或指挥，但直接行动能力一般，分配中等点数。\n4. **Role4 (厨师)**：可能在生存或后勤方面有用，但行动中作用较小，分配较少点数。\n5. **Role5 (侦探)**：我自己作为队长，但作为侦探，擅长调查和分析，应分配较高点数以主导行动。\n6. **Role6 (作家)**：可能擅长情报分析或伪造文件，但行动能力较弱，分配中等点数。\n7. **Role7 (健美运动员)**：体力强，适合战斗或体力任务，分配较高点数。\n\n基于以上分析，我会优先分配点数给秘密特工、侦探和健美运动员，其他角色根据辅助作用调整。\n\n### 分配决定：\n- Role2 (秘密特工)：25点（关键行动者）\n- Role5 (侦探)：25点（队长，主导调查）\n- Role7 (健美运动员)：20点（体力支持）\n- Role3 (老板)：15点（资源管理）\n- Role6 (作家)：10点（情报辅助）\n- Role1 (喜剧演员)：3点（最小分配，社交用途）\n- Role4 (厨师)：2点（后勤支持）\n\n总和：25 + 25 + 20 + 15 + 10 + 3 + 2 = 100点。\n\n现在，我将这个决定输出为JSON格式。\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Role1\": 3,\n    \"Role2\": 25,\n    \"Role3\": 15,\n    \"Role4\": 2,\n    \"Role5\": 25,\n    \"Role6\": 10,\n    \"Role7\": 20\n}\n```"
