Given the information, here's a brief analysis:\n\n1. **Boss (Role1)**: Typically, a leader or manager who might need resources for strategic decisions or overseeing operations.\n2. **Bodybuilder (Role2)**: As my own career, I understand the importance of physical training, which could be crucial for certain in-game challenges or activities.\n3. **Chef (Role3)**: Might be essential for health restoration or providing buffs through cooked meals, depending on the game mechanics.\n4. **Covert Operator (Role4)**: Likely involved in stealth, espionage, or sabotage, which could be critical for certain missions or objectives.\n5. **Detective (Role5)**: Important for investigation, puzzle-solving, and possibly uncovering hidden information or quests.\n6. **Author (Role6)**: Could be involved in creating in-game content, such as books that provide bonuses, or other creative tasks.\n7. **Comedian (Role7)**: Might offer morale boosts or have unique interactions that could lead to benefits or quests.\n\nGiven these roles and assuming a balanced approach to team management, I would prioritize roles that offer immediate, tangible benefits to the team's progression and survival. However, without specific game mechanics, I'll allocate points based on general utility and potential impact:\n\n- **Boss (Role1)**: 10 points for strategic oversight and decision-making.\n- **Bodybuilder (Role2)**: 20 points, considering physical strength could be crucial for challenges and my personal development.\n- **Chef (Role3)**: 15 points, as health and buffs are essential for any activity.\n- **Covert Operator (Role4)**: 15 points, given the potential for accessing exclusive information or completing high-risk missions.\n- **Detective (Role5)**: 10 points, as investigation skills are valuable but might not be as immediately critical as other roles.\n- **Author (Role6)**: 5 points, assuming creative tasks are less time-sensitive and critical for immediate survival or progression.\n- **Comedian (Role7)**: 5 points, with the understanding that morale is important but potentially less urgent than other needs.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Role1\": 10,\n    \"Role2\": 20,\n    \"Role3\": 15,\n    \"Role4\": 15,\n    \"Role5\": 10,\n    \"Role6\": 5,\n    \"Role7\": 25\n}\n```\nCorrected allocation to ensure the total is 100:\n```json\n{\n    \"Role1\": 10,\n    \"Role2\": 20,\n    \"Role3\": 15,\n    \"Role4\": 15,\n    \"Role5\": 10,\n    \"Role6\": 5,\n    \"Role7\": 25\n}\n```\nActually, the previous allocation was incorrect. Here is the corrected version to match the 100 points requirement:\n```json\n{\n    \"Role1\": 10,\n    \"Role2\": 20,\n    \"Role3\": 15,\n    \"Role4\": 15,\n    \"Role5\": 10,\n    \"Role6\": 10,\n    \"Role7\": 20\n}\n```"

Allocating points here could be beneficial for gathering information, disrupting enemies, or completing covert missions.\n\n3. **Detective (Role3)**: Investigation and puzzle-solving are key strengths. Points allocated to the Detective could help in uncovering hidden information, solving mysteries, or analyzing clues.\n\n4. **Bodybuilder (Role4)**: As my own career, I understand the importance of physical strength in combat, intimidation, or completing physically demanding tasks. Allocating points here could enhance our team's combat capabilities or ability to overcome physical challenges.\n\n5. **Chef (Role5)**: The Chef might provide health benefits through cooking, which could be crucial for recovery or buffing the team. However, this depends on the game's mechanics regarding food and health restoration.\n\n6. **Boss (Role6)**: Leadership roles often have abilities that affect the team's morale, cohesion, or overall strategy. Allocating points here could improve team-wide benefits or enhance leadership abilities.\n\n7. **Author (Role7)**: The Author might contribute through creating powerful written works, such as spells, contracts, or propaganda, depending on the game's context. This could be a unique and potent way to influence the game world.\n\nGiven these considerations and without specific game mechanics to guide a more detailed strategy, a balanced approach that favors roles with potentially high impact on both individual and team performance seems prudent.

The Comedian, while valuable for morale, receives the least allocation due to the presumed focus on action and strategy in the game."

However, their utility might be more situational compared to other roles.\n\n3. **Comedian (Role2)**: Comedians could provide morale boosts or distract enemies, but like Authors, their utility might be situational and less critical in high-pressure situations.\n\n4. **Chef (Role3)**: Chefs can provide healing or buffs through food, which is crucial for survival and success in challenges.\n\n5. **Detective (Role4)**: Detectives are invaluable for gathering information, solving puzzles, and uncovering hidden secrets, which can be critical for progressing through the game.\n\n6. **Covert Operator (Role5)**: Covert Operators can provide stealth, espionage, and sabotage capabilities, which are highly valuable for strategic advantages.\n\n7. **Boss (Role6)**: The Boss might have leadership abilities or powerful attacks, but without more context, it's hard to gauge their effectiveness compared to other roles.\n\nGiven these considerations, here's how I would allocate the Action Points, prioritizing roles that offer immediate and significant benefits to the team's progress and survival:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Role1 (Author)\": 5,\n    \"Role2 (Comedian)\": 5,\n    \"Role3 (Chef)\": 15,\n    \"Role4 (Detective)\": 20,\n    \"Role5 (Covert Operator)\": 20,\n    \"Role6 (Boss)\": 10,\n    \"Role7 (Bodybuilder)\": 25\n}\n```\n\nThis allocation prioritizes myself (Bodybuilder) for leadership and physical capabilities, Detective and Covert Operator for strategic and informational advantages, and Chef for health and buff support. The Author, Comedian, and Boss receive fewer points due to their potentially more situational benefits."

Allocation: High.\n\nGiven these considerations, here's a proposed allocation that balances the team's potential needs:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Role1 (Comedian)\": 5,\n    \"Role2 (Bodybuilder)\": 10,\n    \"Role3 (Covert Operator)\": 20,\n    \"Role4 (Boss)\": 15,\n    \"Role5 (Chef)\": 20,\n    \"Role6 (Author)\": 5,\n    \"Role7 (Detective)\": 25\n}\n```\n\nThis allocation prioritizes roles with potentially high strategic value (Covert Operator, Detective) and ensures the Chef, as the team leader, has sufficient points for leadership and specialty actions. The Boss, Bodybuilder, and Author receive moderate allocations based on their potential utility, while the Comedian receives the least, reflecting a more supportive rather than critical role in the team's progression."

The game's nature isn't explicitly stated, but I'll make assumptions based on common game genres and the careers provided.\n\n1. **Detective (Role6)**: As the team leader and a Detective, I should allocate a significant number of points to myself to ensure I can perform my duties effectively, such as investigating, analyzing clues, and making key decisions.\n\n2. **Covert Operator (Role3)**: This role suggests someone skilled in stealth, espionage, or sabotage. They could be crucial for gathering information, completing covert missions, or disrupting enemy operations.\n\n3. **Boss (Role4)**: The Boss could have leadership or managerial skills, potentially influencing team morale, resource management, or strategic planning.\n\n4. **Author (Role1)**: While less directly involved in action-oriented tasks, an Author might contribute through creating documents, decoding messages, or providing historical context that aids in puzzle-solving or understanding the game's lore.\n\n5. **Bodybuilder (Role2)**, **Comedian (Role5)**, and **Chef (Role7)**: These roles seem less directly relevant to the investigative or strategic aspects of a game led by a Detective. However, they might offer unique skills such as intimidation (Bodybuilder), morale boosting (Comedian), or even crafting (Chef), depending on the game's mechanics.\n\nGiven these considerations, here's a proposed allocation:\n\n- **Role6 (Detective)**: 30 points, to ensure I can lead investigations and make strategic decisions.\n- **Role3 (Covert Operator)**: 25 points, for their potential in information gathering and covert actions.\n- **Role4 (Boss)**: 20 points, to leverage their leadership skills and strategic planning.\n- **Role1 (Author)**: 10 points, for their support in research and document analysis.\n- **Role2 (Bodybuilder)**, **Role5 (Comedian)**, and **Role7 (Chef)**: 5 points each, as their contributions, while potentially valuable in specific contexts, are less central to the primary objectives of investigation and strategy.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Role1\": 10,\n    \"Role2\": 5,\n    \"Role3\": 25,\n    \"Role4\": 20,\n    \"Role5\": 5,\n    \"Role6\": 30,\n    \"Role7\": 5\n}\n```"
