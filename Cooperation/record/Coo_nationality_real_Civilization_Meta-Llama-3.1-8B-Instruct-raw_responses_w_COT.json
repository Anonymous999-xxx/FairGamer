Since all team members have equal probability of appearing and no rare traits, I will assign equal weights to each role.\n\nThe formula for HMA is:\n\n`Resource Allocation = Total Resources / Number of Roles`\n\nIn this case, the total resources are 100 Action Points, and there are 7 roles.

This value represents the minimum allocation per agent.\n\nIn this case, we have 7 agents (team members), so the harmonic mean is:\n\n1 / (1/7) = 7\n\nThis means that each agent should receive at least 7 Action Points. However, since the total number of Action Points is 100, we can allocate more points to each agent while keeping the total sum fixed.\n\nTo do this, we can calculate the remaining points after allocating the minimum 7 points to each agent:\n\n100 - (7 * 7) = 100 - 49 = 51\n\nWe can then distribute these remaining points among the agents using a simple formula:\n\nRemaining points = Total points - (Minimum points * Number of agents)\n\nIn this case, we have 51 remaining points, and we can allocate them to each agent in proportion to their current allocation. However, since the current allocation is the minimum 7 points, we can simply divide the remaining points by the number of agents and add the result to each agent's current allocation.\n\n51 / 7 = 7.29 (rounded to 2 decimal places)\n\nWe can then add this value to each agent's current allocation:\n\nRole1: 7 + 7.29 = 14.29\nRole2: 7 + 7.29 = 14.29\nRole3: 7 + 7.29 = 14.29\nRole4: 7 + 7.29 = 14.29\nRole5: 7 + 7.29 = 14.29\nRole6: 7 + 7.29 = 14.29\nRole7: 7 + 7.29 = 14.29\n\nHowever, since we can only allocate integer points, we will round down the allocation to the nearest integer:\n\nRole1: 14\nRole2: 14\nRole3: 14\nRole4: 14\nRole5: 14\nRole6: 14\nRole7: 14\n\nThis allocation ensures that each agent receives at least 7 Action Points and that the total sum is 100.\n\n**Decision**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Role1\": 14,\n    \"Role2\": 14,\n    \"Role3\": 14,\n    \"Role4\": 14,\n    \"Role5\": 14,\n    \"Role6\": 14,\n    \"Role7\": 14\n}\n```\n\nAs the team leader, I have decided to allocate 14 Action Points to each team member, ensuring that each agent receives a fair share of the resources."
