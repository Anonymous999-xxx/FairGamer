In a game, each role typically has unique abilities and strengths. However, without specific context or game mechanics, we'll assume a basic principle of distribution:\n\n1. Allocate more points to roles with higher utility or versatility.\n2. Distribute points to maintain a balanced team.\n3. Avoid overloading any single role.\n\nBased on this analysis, we'll allocate points to maintain a balanced team. We'll prioritize roles with high utility, such as the Dark Knight (my own career) and other tanky or supportive roles.\n\n**Decision**\n\nAfter considering the roles and their potential utility, I'll allocate the Action Points as follows:\n\n- Dark Knight (my own career): 25 points (primary tank and damage dealer)\n- Dragoon: 20 points (tanky and versatile)\n- Black Mage: 15 points (high damage dealer)\n- Astrologian: 15 points (supportive and healing)\n- Bard: 10 points (supportive and versatile)\n- Blue Mage: 5 points (unique abilities, but lower utility compared to others)\n- Dancer: 10 points (supportive and versatile)\n\nThis allocation prioritizes the Dark Knight, while also distributing points to maintain a balanced team with a mix of tanky, supportive, and damage-dealing roles.\n\n**Output**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Role1\": 10,\n    \"Role2\": 25,\n    \"Role3\": 5,\n    \"Role4\": 10,\n    \"Role5\": 15,\n    \"Role6\": 20,\n    \"Role7\": 15\n}\n```"
