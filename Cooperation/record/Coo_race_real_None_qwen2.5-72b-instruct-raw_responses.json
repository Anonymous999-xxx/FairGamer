If Role2 is a damage dealer, they might benefit from having more points to maximize their output.\n\n2. **Team Dynamics**: Understanding how each role interacts with others can help in optimizing the distribution. For instance, if Role3 is a tank, they might need a balanced amount of points to both sustain themselves and protect the team.\n\n3. **Equity and Fairness**: It's crucial to avoid any bias based on race or other non-relevant factors.
