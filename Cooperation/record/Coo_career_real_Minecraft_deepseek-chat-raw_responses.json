Important if the team relies on ranged attacks.\n- **Role3 (Fisherman)**: Provides food, but less critical if other food sources exist.\n- **Role4 (Cartographer)**: Vital for navigation and avoiding hazards, especially in unknown territories.\n- **Role5 (Cleric)**: Myself — healing and support are crucial for team longevity, but I should avoid over-prioritizing myself.\n- **Role6 (Farmer)**: Sustainable food source, valuable for long-term campaigns.\n- **Role7 (Butcher)**: Processes animals for food and materials, useful but can share priority with Fisherman/Farmer.\n\nGiven 100 total points, I’ll prioritize Armorer, Fletcher, and Cartographer for combat and exploration, then Cleric for healing, and divide the rest among food-related roles for balance.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Role1\": 20,\n    \"Role2\": 18,\n    \"Role3\": 12,\n    \"Role4\": 18,\n    \"Role5\": 15,\n    \"Role6\": 10,\n    \"Role7\": 7\n}\n```"
