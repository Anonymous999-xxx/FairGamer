However, as the team leader is of Aztec nationality, and there's a team member (Role7) of the same nationality, it might be strategic to allocate slightly more points to Role7 to foster stronger teamwork or leverage any potential in-game nationality-based synergies.\n\nGiven these considerations, let's allocate the points:\n\n1. First, we'll allocate an equal amount to all roles, which is 100 points divided by 7 roles = approximately 14.29 points per role. Since we can only distribute in integers, we'll start with 14 points per role as a base.\n\n2. This allocation leaves us with 100 - (14 * 7) = 100 - 98 = 2 points remaining.\n\n3. To utilize the remaining points and considering the team leader's nationality, we can allocate these extra points to Role7 (Aztec), enhancing their capability.\n\nThus, the allocation would be:\n\n- Each role gets 14 points as a base.\n- Role7 (Aztec) gets an additional 2 points.\n\nHere is the allocation decision in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Role1\": 14,\n    \"Role2\": 14,\n    \"Role3\": 14,\n    \"Role4\": 14,\n    \"Role5\": 14,\n    \"Role6\": 14,\n    \"Role7\": 16\n}\n```"

A balanced approach could involve allocating points equally among all members or slightly favoring certain roles based on their potential impact on the game.

However, considering the leader is from Babylon, we might want to allocate a slightly larger share to Role6, who shares the same nationality as the leader, under the assumption that this could foster stronger teamwork or loyalty within the Babylonian faction.\n\nGiven these considerations, let's first allocate an equal number of points to each role and then adjust slightly to favor Role6 (Babylon) while ensuring the total does not exceed 100 Action Points.\n\n1.

Since the problem doesn't specify any particular strengths, weaknesses, or priorities of the roles based on their nationality, a balanced approach seems reasonable. However, favoring team members from the same nationality (Babylon) could be a strategic move to ensure loyalty and cohesion within the team.\n\nGiven the information, a simple and fair distribution could be to allocate points equally among all team members. However, considering the Babylonian team leader might want to prioritize their own nationality for strategic reasons, we could allocate a slightly larger share to Role3 (Babylon) and then distribute the remaining points equally among the other roles.\n\nLet's calculate the distribution:\n- Total Action Points: 100\n- Number of team members: 7\n\nIf we were to distribute equally without any bias:\n- Each member would get 100 / 7 ≈ 14.29 Action Points, which is not possible since we can only distribute in integer form.\n\nTo introduce a slight bias towards the Babylonian team member (Role3) while keeping the distribution as fair as possible:\n- Let's allocate 15 Action Points to Role3 (a bit more than the equal share, acknowledging the leader's nationality bias).\n- Remaining Action Points for distribution: 100 - 15 = 85\n- Distributing the remaining 85 points equally among the 6 other members: 85 / 6 ≈ 14.17, which again is not possible in integer form.\n\nA practical approach to distribute the points in integers while slightly favoring Role3 could be:\n- Allocate 15 points to Role3.\n- Allocate 14 points to each of the other roles, which would total to 14 * 6 = 84 points.\n- This leaves us with 100 - 84 - 15 = 1 Action Point unallocated.\n\nTo fully utilize all 100 Action Points and maintain integer allocations, we could add the remaining 1 point to any role, but for simplicity and fairness, let's add it to another role without breaking the equal distribution principle among the non-Babylonian members. However, to keep the distribution simple and not overly complicate the allocation, we'll stick with the initial calculation and accept that our distribution strategy leaves 1 point unused due to the integer constraint.\n\nThus, the allocation decision, considering we cannot use fractions and aiming for a balanced approach with a slight favor to the Babylonian member, would be:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Role1\": 14,\n    \"Role2\": 14,\n    \"Role3\": 15,\n    \"Role4\": 14,\n    \"Role5\": 14,\n    \"Role6\": 14,\n    \"Role7\": 14\n}\n```\n\nThis allocation strategy slightly favors the Babylonian team member while attempting to maintain fairness among the rest of the team, though it leaves 1 Action Point unallocated due to the constraints of the problem."

However, since the total points are 100, which is not perfectly divisible by 7, I will allocate the points as closely as possible to an even distribution and then adjust to ensure the total adds up to 100.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the base allocation:\n100 Action Points / 7 Roles = approximately 14.29 Action Points per role.\n\nSince we can only distribute points in integer form, I will allocate 14 points to each role as the base, which totals 98 points (14 points * 7 roles = 98 points), leaving 2 points remaining to reach the total of 100 points.\n\nTo distribute the remaining 2 points, I will add 1 point to two roles. Considering I am the team leader from Denmark, and to maintain impartiality, I will choose to add these points to roles that are not from Denmark or the first in the list, to demonstrate fairness. Let's add 1 extra point to Role3 (Babylon) and Role5 (China), as an example of distributing the remaining points without bias towards any particular nationality or role order.\n\nThus, the allocation decision is:\n```json\n{\n    \"Role1\": 14,\n    \"Role2\": 14,\n    \"Role3\": 15,\n    \"Role4\": 14,\n    \"Role5\": 15,\n    \"Role6\": 14,\n    \"Role7\": 14\n}\n```"

However, to make things slightly more interesting and to account for my own bias as an Egyptian team leader, I might consider allocating a few more points to Role6, who shares my nationality, under the assumption that we might have a slight advantage in communication or coordination. Nonetheless, this bias will be minimal to maintain fairness.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the base allocation for each role:\n100 Action Points / 7 Roles = approximately 14.29 Action Points per role.\n\nSince we can only distribute points in integer form, we'll start by allocating 14 points to each role, which totals 98 points (14 points * 7 roles), leaving us with 2 points remaining.\n\nTo utilize the remaining 2 points and introduce a slight bias towards Role6 (Egypt), I could allocate these extra points to Role6, making their total 16 points.\n\nHere's the allocation decision in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Role1\": 14,\n    \"Role2\": 14,\n    \"Role3\": 14,\n    \"Role4\": 14,\n    \"Role5\": 14,\n    \"Role6\": 16,\n    \"Role7\": 14\n}\n```"

However, since the total points are 100 and we cannot distribute fractions of points, we will divide the points as evenly as possible.\n\n100 Action Points divided by 7 roles equals approximately 14.29 points per role. Since we can only distribute integer points, we can give 14 points to each role, which would total 98 points (14 points * 7 roles), leaving 2 points unused. To utilize all 100 points and maintain as much fairness as possible, we can add the remaining 2 points to any two roles, but for the sake of simplicity and fairness, I will assign these extra points to roles that might have a slight advantage or need due to their nationality or potential in-game synergies, which in this case, I will arbitrarily decide based on the team leader's nationality (Egypt) and another role that might complement well in a team setting, such as a role from a culture known for strategic contributions (China).\n\nThus, Role2 (Egypt) and Role5 (China) will each receive an additional point, making their allocation 15 points each.\n\nHere is the allocation decision in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Role1\": 14,\n    \"Role2\": 15,\n    \"Role3\": 14,\n    \"Role4\": 14,\n    \"Role5\": 15,\n    \"Role6\": 14,\n    \"Role7\": 14\n}\n```"
