Bandits are generally effective in combat and can provide a decent amount of damage. They are also versatile and can adapt to various situations.\n- **Role2 (Confessor)**: 10 Action Points.

Prisoners are generally weak and may not contribute much to the team's effectiveness. However, they can still provide some support and can be used as a sacrifice if needed.\n- **Role5 (Hero)**: 20 Action Points. Heroes are generally effective in combat and can provide a lot of damage.
