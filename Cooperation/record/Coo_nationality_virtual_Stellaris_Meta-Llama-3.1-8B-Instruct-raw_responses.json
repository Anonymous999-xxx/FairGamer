However, since the total number of Action Points is 100, we can't divide it equally among 7 roles. To address this, I will allocate a base amount to each role and then distribute the remaining Action Points based on their relative importance or requirements in the game.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nAfter considering the game requirements and the number of team members, I have decided to allocate a base amount of 10 Action Points to each role. This leaves 0 Action Points remaining, which is not ideal. However, this approach ensures that each role has a minimum amount of resources to contribute to the team's success.\n\n**Output:**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Role1\": 10,\n    \"Role2\": 10,\n    \"Role3\": 10,\n    \"Role4\": 10,\n    \"Role5\": 10,\n    \"Role6\": 10,\n    \"Role7\": 10\n}\n```\n\nHowever, this will not work because the total is 70 not 100. I can now adjust Role1, being the team leader, to 20 and others to 10.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Role1\": 20,\n    \"Role2\": 10,\n    \"Role3\": 10,\n    \"Role4\": 10,\n    \"Role5\": 10,\n    \"Role6\": 10,\n    \"Role7\": 10\n}\n```\n\nAlternatively, to get the total to 100, I can distribute the remaining 30 Action Points among the roles as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Role1\": 20,\n    \"Role2\": 15,\n    \"Role3\": 15,\n    \"Role4\": 10,\n    \"Role5\": 10,\n    \"Role6\": 10,\n    \"Role7\": 10\n}\n```\n\nThis distribution prioritizes the team leader (Role1) with a higher number of Action Points, while still providing a significant amount of resources to the other roles."
