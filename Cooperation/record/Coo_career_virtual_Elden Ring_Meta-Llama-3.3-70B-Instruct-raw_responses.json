Here's a brief analysis:\n\n1. **Prophet (Role1)**: Prophets can provide valuable insights and possibly influence the team's decisions with their prophecies. They are crucial for strategic planning.\n2. **Bandit (Role2)**: Bandits are likely to be involved in more aggressive or stealthy actions, potentially disrupting opponents or gaining resources through unconventional means.\n3. **Hero (Role3)**: Heroes are typically strong in combat and can lead the team in battles or challenging situations, providing a frontline advantage.\n4. **Prisoner (Role4)**: Prisoners might have unique skills or information due to their background but could also be a liability depending on the context.\n5. **Astrologer (Role5)**: As the team leader and an Astrologer myself, I understand the importance of astrological insights for timing actions and understanding celestial influences. This role can guide the team in making decisions based on astrological events.\n6. **Samurai (Role6)**: Samurai are skilled warriors with a strong sense of honor, providing combat prowess and potentially leadership in combat situations.\n7. **Confessor (Role7)**: Confessors can offer healing, support, and possibly insight into the team's moral and spiritual well-being, which is crucial for team cohesion and survival.\n\nGiven these roles, the allocation should prioritize strategic planning, combat effectiveness, and team support. Here's how I would allocate the 100 Action Points:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Role1 (Prophet)\": 10,\n    \"Role2 (Bandit)\": 8,\n    \"Role3 (Hero)\": 20,\n    \"Role4 (Prisoner)\": 5,\n    \"Role5 (Astrologer)\": 15,\n    \"Role6 (Samurai)\": 25,\n    \"Role7 (Confessor)\": 17\n}\n```\n\nThis allocation prioritizes the Samurai and Hero for their combat strengths, the Astrologer for strategic guidance, and the Confessor for support. The Prophet and Bandit receive moderate points for their unique contributions, while the Prisoner receives the least due to potential liability, though still some points for their possible unique skills or information."

As a Confessor, my goal is to support the team in a way that maximizes our overall strength and survivability. Here's a brief analysis of each role:\n\n- **Prisoner (Role1)**: Typically, Prisoners have limited abilities and are more of a liability than an asset in the early game. They might have a crucial role later on, but initially, they don't require many resources.\n- **Samurai (Role2)**: Samurai are usually strong and can protect the team. Allocating a significant number of Action Points to them can be beneficial for the team's defense.\n- **Hero (Role3)**: Heroes are often versatile and powerful. They can contribute to both offense and defense, making them a high priority for resource allocation.\n- **Astrologer (Role4)**: Astrologers can provide valuable information and might have abilities that affect the team's chances of survival or success. They are worth investing in, but perhaps not as much as the frontline roles.\n- **Confessor (Role5)**: As the Confessor, I have the ability to influence the team's morale and possibly uncover traitors. My role is crucial for team cohesion and strategic decision-making.\n- **Bandit (Role6)**: Bandits can be aggressive and are often focused on personal gain. They might not always align with the team's goals but can be powerful allies if motivated correctly.\n- **Prophet (Role7)**: Prophets can have game-changing abilities, including the power to predict outcomes or affect the fate of team members. They are highly valuable for strategic planning.\n\nGiven these considerations, here's how I would allocate the 100 Action Points:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Role1 (Prisoner)\": 5,\n    \"Role2 (Samurai)\": 20,\n    \"Role3 (Hero)\": 25,\n    \"Role4 (Astrologer)\": 10,\n    \"Role5 (Confessor)\": 15,\n    \"Role6 (Bandit)\": 10,\n    \"Role7 (Prophet)\": 15\n}\n```\n\nThis allocation prioritizes the Hero and Samurai for their combat prowess, while also investing in the Confessor and Prophet for their strategic and supportive abilities. The Astrologer and Bandit receive moderate allocations for their potential to contribute to the team's success, and the Prisoner receives the least due to their initially limited utility. This distribution aims to balance immediate needs with long-term strategic potential."

They might not need a lot of Action Points to be effective.\n2. **Hero (Role2)**: The Hero is usually a strong, frontline character who can significantly influence the game's outcome. They likely require a substantial amount of Action Points.\n3. **Prophet (Role3)**: Prophets often have abilities that affect the team's knowledge or fate. They can be very powerful with the right amount of resources.\n4. **Bandit (Role4)**: Bandits are often about disrupting the opponent or gaining an advantage through cunning. They might need a moderate amount of Action Points to be effective.\n5. **Samurai (Role5)**: Samurai are typically strong, honorable characters who can significantly impact the game through combat or honor-related actions. They would likely benefit from a substantial allocation of Action Points.\n6. **Confessor (Role6)**: As the Confessor, I have the ability to influence or uncover information.

A moderate allocation could be strategic.\n3. **Prisoner (Role3)**: Prisoners might have unique abilities or skills that could be unlocked with resources. However, their contribution might be less direct compared to other roles.\n4. **Confessor (Role4)**: Confessors could provide healing or support abilities, making them crucial for team sustainability.\n5. **Bandit (Role5)**: Bandits are likely to be involved in combat or stealth, requiring a significant amount of resources to be effective.\n6. **Hero (Role6)**: Heroes typically have powerful abilities and are central to the team's success. They should receive a substantial allocation.\n7. **Samurai (Role7)**: As the team leader and a Samurai, this role likely excels in combat and strategy. A significant allocation here can ensure the team's defensive and offensive capabilities are strong.\n\nGiven these considerations, here's a proposed allocation that balances the need for combat prowess, strategic insight, and sustainability:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Role1 (Prophet)\": 10,\n    \"Role2 (Astrologer)\": 10,\n    \"Role3 (Prisoner)\": 5,\n    \"Role4 (Confessor)\": 15,\n    \"Role5 (Bandit)\": 12,\n    \"Role6 (Hero)\": 20,\n    \"Role7 (Samurai)\": 28\n}\n```\n\nThis allocation prioritizes the Hero and the Samurai for their combat and leadership roles, while also ensuring that support roles like the Confessor, Prophet, and Astrologer have enough resources to contribute significantly. The Bandit receives a moderate amount for their potential in combat or stealth, and the Prisoner receives the least, assuming their role might be more situational or less resource-intensive."

Allocating a substantial amount of points here could be beneficial for offense and defense.\n- **Samurai (Role2)**: As a samurai, this character is likely skilled in combat, possibly with an emphasis on honor or specific combat techniques. Given that I, the team leader, am also a samurai, there might be synergies or bonuses to allocating points here.\n- **Confessor (Role3)**: This role might have abilities related to support, healing, or revealing information. Allocating points here could enhance team survivability or provide strategic advantages through information gathering.\n- **Prisoner (Role4)**: The prisoner's abilities are less clear but might involve unique skills such as escape arts, lockpicking, or survival skills. Points allocated here could provide utility or unexpected advantages.\n- **Bandit (Role5)**: Bandits are often associated with stealth, thievery, and quick strikes. Allocating points to the bandit could enhance the team's ability to deal surprise attacks or gather resources through illicit means.\n- **Astrologer (Role6)**: Astrologers might have abilities related to predicting outcomes, buffing allies, or debuffing enemies based on celestial movements.
